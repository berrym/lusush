## üéØ REMAINING WORK (5% - High Value Polish)

### Issue #1: Git Status Interactive Mode (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Estimated Time**: 2-4 hours  
**Problem**: `git status` doesn't display output in interactive mode (TTY), but works perfectly in non-interactive mode  
**Impact**: Affects external commands that expect proper TTY behavior  
**Guide**: `GIT_STATUS_INVESTIGATION_GUIDE.md` (276 lines of technical analysis)

### Issue #2: Syntax Highlighting (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours  
**Problem**: Framework exists but no actual implementation  
**Goal**: Real-time command coloring (commands green, strings yellow, variables cyan)  
**Guide**: `SYNTAX_HIGHLIGHTING_GUIDE.md` (453 lines of implementation strategy)

## üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### For Next AI Assistant

1. **Read handoff documentation** (start with `NEXT_AI_ASSISTANT_READLINE_ENHANCEMENT.md`)
2. **Test current state** using provided quick commands
3. **Focus on git status issue** - highest priority, well-documented investigation path
4. **Implement syntax highlighting** - optional enhancement, complete framework provided
5. **Maintain existing quality** - preserve all working features

### Development Environment
```bash
# Get latest code
git checkout feature/readline-integration
git pull origin feature/readline-integration

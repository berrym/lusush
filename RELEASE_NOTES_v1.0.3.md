# LUSUSH v1.0.3 Release Notes

**Release Date**: January 7, 2025  
**Version**: 1.0.3  
**Codename**: "Perfect Precision"  
**Status**: Critical Fix Release

## 🎯 Critical Fixes Release

LUSUSH v1.0.3 addresses three critical issues that were discovered after the v1.0.2 release. This version provides **complete stability** for all terminal editing operations while maintaining the bottom-line cursor jumping fix from v1.0.2.

## 🔧 What's Fixed in v1.0.3

### ✅ **Issue 1: Character Deletion Artifacts - RESOLVED**
- **Problem**: When using backspace to delete characters, the cursor moved backwards but deleted characters remained as visual artifacts on the screen
- **Root Cause**: The optimized refresh approach in v1.0.2 cleared the line and rewrote content but failed to position the cursor correctly
- **Solution**: Added proper cursor positioning after line rewrite using `\r\x1b[%dC` sequence
- **Impact**: Clean character deletion with no visual artifacts

### ✅ **Issue 2: Runtime Hints Configuration - RESOLVED**
- **Problem**: Using `config set hints_enabled true` didn't actually enable hints during runtime
- **Root Cause**: Hints callbacks were only set during initialization, not when configuration changed at runtime
- **Solution**: Added hints callback management to `config_apply_settings()` function
- **Impact**: Users can now enable/disable hints dynamically during shell session

### ✅ **Issue 3: History Navigation Creating New Prompts - RESOLVED**
- **Problem**: History navigation (up/down arrows) sometimes created new prompt lines instead of replacing current content
- **Root Cause**: Same cursor positioning issue as backspace - line rewrite without proper cursor positioning
- **Solution**: Added proper cursor positioning after history line rewrite
- **Impact**: Smooth history navigation with correct line replacement

## 📊 Technical Implementation Details

### Cursor Positioning Fix
The core issue was in the optimized refresh logic introduced in v1.0.2. While the optimization successfully prevented bottom-line cursor jumping, it missed a crucial step:

```c
/* NEW: Proper cursor positioning after line rewrite */
char seq[64];
snprintf(seq, sizeof(seq), "\r\x1b[%dC",
         (int)(promptTextColumnLen(l->prompt, l->plen) +
               columnPos(l->buf, l->len, l->pos)));
if (write(l->ofd, seq, strlen(seq)) == -1) {
    refreshLine(l);
    return;
}
```

This ensures the cursor is positioned correctly after:
1. Clearing the line (`\r\x1b[0K`)
2. Writing the prompt
3. Writing the buffer content
4. **NEW**: Positioning cursor at the correct location

### Runtime Configuration Fix
Enhanced the `config_apply_settings()` function to handle hints system:

```c
/* NEW: Apply hints system settings dynamically */
if (config.hints_enabled) {
    linenoiseSetHintsCallback(lusush_hints_callback);
    linenoiseSetFreeHintsCallback(lusush_free_hints_callback);
} else {
    linenoiseSetHintsCallback(NULL);
    linenoiseSetFreeHintsCallback(NULL);
}
```

This allows users to enable/disable hints at runtime without restarting the shell.

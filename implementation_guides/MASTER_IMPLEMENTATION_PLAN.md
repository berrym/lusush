## 🧪 TESTING STRATEGY

### Continuous Regression Testing
```bash
# After each phase, run full test suite
./test_interactive.sh           # All interactive features
./test_multiline.sh            # Complex shell constructs
./test_git_integration.sh      # Git status in prompts  
./test_themes.sh               # All 6 themes
./test_completion.sh           # Tab completion system

# Expected: ALL TESTS PASS after every phase
```

### Performance Benchmarking
```bash
# Establish baseline before Phase 1
time for i in {1..100}; do echo "echo test$i" | ./builddir/lusush -i > /dev/null; done

# Compare after each phase
# Expected: No regression, improvements in Phase 3
```

### Memory and Safety Testing
```bash
# Memory leak testing after each phase
valgrind --leak-check=full ./builddir/lusush -c 'echo "test with highlighting"'

# Safety testing in special modes
# Test: Ctrl+R search, tab completion, arrow keys, multiline
# Expected: No corruption, all modes work perfectly
```

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Phase 1 Issues
**Problem**: Too many trigger events  
**Solution**: Adjust throttling parameters in `should_trigger_highlighting()`  
**Debug**: Enable debug logging to see trigger patterns

**Problem**: Performance regression  
**Solution**: Review character detection logic, ensure O(1) operations  
**Debug**: Profile with `perf` or `gprof`

#### Phase 2 Issues  
**Problem**: Display corruption  
**Solution**: Enhance safety checks in `is_safe_for_highlighting()`  
**Debug**: Test in all special readline modes systematically

**Problem**: Cursor positioning wrong  
**Solution**: Fix `calculate_adjusted_cursor_position()` for color codes  
**Debug**: Use terminal escape sequence debugging

#### Phase 3 Issues
**Problem**: Cache not effective  
**Solution**: Tune change detection algorithm  
**Debug**: Monitor cache hit rates in debug output

**Problem**: Memory usage too high  
**Solution**: Optimize memory pool size, review buffer management  
**Debug**: Use `valgrind --tool=massif` for memory profiling

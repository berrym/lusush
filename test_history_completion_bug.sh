echo ""

echo "Problem 1: Completion System Triggers on Arrow Keys"
echo "  Evidence: [COMPLETION_DEBUG] appeared during testing"
echo "  Root cause: Completion function being called when it shouldn't be"
echo "  Fix: Ensure arrow keys are completely unbound from completion"
echo ""

echo "Problem 2: Large Completion Lists Interfere with History"
echo "  Evidence: '4418 possibilities' number in user reports"
echo "  Root cause: When completion does trigger, it shows all system commands"
echo "  Fix: Prevent completion from triggering on non-TAB keys"
echo ""

echo "Problem 3: Key Binding Conflicts"
echo "  Evidence: Arrow keys not behaving as history navigation"
echo "  Root cause: Custom bindings or configuration overriding default behavior"
echo "  Fix: Remove ALL custom arrow key bindings, let readline handle natively"
echo ""

echo "=== IMPLEMENTATION PLAN ==="
echo ""

echo "1. REMOVE any explicit arrow key bindings in src/readline_integration.c"
echo "2. ENSURE rl_attempted_completion_function doesn't trigger on arrow keys"
echo "3. VERIFY completion only triggers on TAB, not on arrow keys"
echo "4. TEST that default readline history navigation works"
echo ""

echo "Key files to modify:"
echo "  - src/readline_integration.c: Remove arrow key bindings"
echo "  - src/readline_integration.c: Fix completion trigger conditions"

echo "The core issue appears to be that completion is being triggered by"
echo "arrow keys instead of history navigation being handled by readline's"
echo "default mechanisms."

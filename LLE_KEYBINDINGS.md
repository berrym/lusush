# Lusush Line Editor (LLE) - Keybinding Reference

## Overview

The Lusush Line Editor (LLE) follows **GNU Readline/Emacs** keybinding conventions to provide a familiar and consistent editing experience. This document outlines all supported keybindings and their functions.

## Standard Readline Compatibility

LLE is designed to be compatible with standard readline keybindings used in bash, zsh, and other shells. This ensures users can leverage their existing muscle memory when using Lusush.

## Keybinding Categories

### Line Completion
| Key | Function | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| `Enter` | Accept line | Complete input and return result |
| `Ctrl+M` | Accept line | Alternative to Enter |
| `Ctrl+J` | Accept line | Alternative to Enter |
| `Ctrl+G` | Cancel line | Cancel current input and return NULL (standard readline abort) |
| `Ctrl+D` | EOF/Delete | EOF if buffer empty, otherwise delete character |

### Navigation
| Key | Function | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| `Left Arrow` | Move left | Move cursor one character left |
| `Right Arrow` | Move right | Move cursor one character right |
| `Ctrl+B` | Move left | Emacs-style left movement |
| `Ctrl+F` | Move right | Emacs-style right movement |
| `Home` | Beginning of line | Move cursor to start of line |
| `End` | End of line | Move cursor to end of line |
| `Ctrl+A` | Beginning of line | Emacs-style home |
| `Ctrl+E` | End of line | Emacs-style end |
| `Alt+B` | Word left | Move cursor one word left |
| `Alt+F` | Word right | Move cursor one word right |

### History Navigation
| Key | Function | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| `Up Arrow` | Previous history | Navigate to previous command |
| `Down Arrow` | Next history | Navigate to next command |
| `Ctrl+P` | Previous history | Emacs-style up |
| `Ctrl+N` | Next history | Emacs-style down |

### Text Editing
| Key | Function | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| `Backspace` | Delete backward | Delete character before cursor |
| `Ctrl+H` | Delete backward | Alternative to Backspace |
| `Delete` | Delete forward | Delete character at cursor |

| `Alt+D` | Kill word forward | Delete word after cursor |

### Undo/Redo System
| Key | Function | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| `Ctrl+_` | Undo | Undo last editing operation (standard readline) |

**Note**: `Ctrl+_` is typed as Control+Underscore. This is the standard readline undo keybinding.

### Kill Ring (Cut/Paste)
| Key | Function | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| `Ctrl+Y` | Yank | Paste from kill ring *(TODO: not yet implemented)* |

### Screen Control
| Key | Function | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| `Ctrl+L` | Clear screen | Clear screen and redraw prompt |

### Completion
| Key | Function | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| `Tab` | Complete | Trigger auto-completion *(framework ready)* |

## Important Notes

### Signal Handling and Shell Integration
- **LLE respects Unix signal conventions** - signal-generating keys are handled by the shell, not the line editor
- **`Ctrl+C` (SIGINT)** - Handled by shell for interrupt signal; LLE ignores this key
- **`Ctrl+G` (abort)** - Standard readline abort command; cancels current line in LLE
- **`Ctrl+\` (SIGQUIT)** - Handled by shell for quit signal; LLE ignores this key
- **`Ctrl+Z` (SIGTSTP)** - Reserved for Unix job control (suspend); NOT used for undo
- **`Ctrl+S`/`Ctrl+Q` (XON/XOFF)** - Handled by terminal for flow control; LLE ignores these keys
- LLE follows standard readline conventions where `Ctrl+_` is the undo keybinding and `Ctrl+G` is abort
- This ensures LLE doesn't interfere with essential Unix shell and terminal functionality

### Emacs vs Vi Mode
- LLE currently implements **Emacs-style keybindings** by default
- Vi-style keybindings are not yet implemented but may be added in future versions

### Unicode Support
- All text editing operations support full UTF-8/Unicode
- Navigation commands are character-aware (not byte-aware)
- Word boundaries respect Unicode word separation rules

## Advanced Features

### Feature-Specific Keybindings
These keybindings are only active when the respective features are enabled:

#### Syntax Highlighting
- Automatic highlighting based on shell syntax
- No specific keybindings (visual feedback only)

#### Auto-completion
- `Tab` - Trigger completion menu *(when implemented)*

#### History Features
- History navigation respects `hist_no_dups` setting
- Duplicate commands automatically move to end when re-entered

## Configuration

### Runtime Feature Control
LLE features can be enabled/disabled at runtime through the API:
- Multiline mode: `lle_set_multiline_mode(editor, bool)`
- Syntax highlighting: `lle_set_syntax_highlighting(editor, bool)`
- Auto-completion: `lle_set_auto_completion(editor, bool)`
- History: `lle_set_history_enabled(editor, bool)`
- Undo system: `lle_set_undo_enabled(editor, bool)`

### Customization
- LLE is designed to be embeddable and configurable
- Custom keybindings can be implemented through the input handler system
- Theme integration provides visual customization

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Fully Implemented
- All basic text editing operations
- Navigation (character, word, line)
- History navigation and management
- Undo system with `Ctrl+_`
- Screen control and display management

### üöß In Development
- Tab completion (framework complete, implementation pending)
- Kill ring/yank system (`Ctrl+Y`)
- Proper signal integration with shell (currently using fallback behavior)

### üìã Future Enhancements
- Vi-style keybinding mode
- Custom keybinding configuration
- Advanced completion features
- Multi-line editing enhancements

## Compatibility Matrix

| Shell/Editor | Keybinding Compatibility |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| Bash (readline) | ‚úÖ Full compatibility |
| Zsh (ZLE) | ‚úÖ High compatibility |
| Fish | ‚úÖ Most keybindings |
| Emacs | ‚úÖ Text editing subset |
| Vi/Vim | ‚ùå Different paradigm |

## Error Handling

### Non-TTY Environments
- All keybindings work in TTY environments
- In non-TTY environments (pipes, redirects), LLE provides graceful degradation
- Input still processed but display updates may be limited

### Signal and Terminal Integration
- LLE implements proper separation of concerns for control characters
- **Signal-generating keys** (`Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+\`) are handled by shell signal system
- **Flow control keys** (`Ctrl+S`, `Ctrl+Q`) are handled by terminal driver
- **Job control keys** (`Ctrl+Z`) are handled by shell job control
- **Line editing keys** (`Ctrl+G` for abort, `Ctrl+_` for undo, etc.) are handled by LLE readline system
- This ensures proper Unix behavior and prevents conflicts between subsystems

## Performance

- Key event processing: < 1ms per keystroke
- Display updates: < 5ms per render
- History navigation: < 1ms per entry
- All operations optimized for real-time responsiveness

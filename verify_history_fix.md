# LLE-R003 History Navigation Fix Verification

## Overview
This document provides a simple manual test to verify that the history navigation fix is working correctly. The fix integrates the display stabilization system with history navigation to resolve the character duplication and display corruption issues.

## Changes Made
1. **Added display_stabilization.h include** to line_editor.c
2. **Replaced direct display fallback** with stabilization error recovery in history navigation
3. **Applied type casting** for compatibility between `lle_display_state_t` and `struct lle_display_state`

## Manual Verification Steps

### Step 1: Basic History Navigation Test
```bash
# Build the fixed version
cd lusush
scripts/lle_build.sh build

# Start Lusush with debug output
LLE_DEBUG=1 ./builddir/lusush
```

### Step 2: Create Test History
In the Lusush shell, enter these commands:
```bash
echo "first command"
echo "second command" 
echo "third command"
pwd
ls -la
```

### Step 3: Test Up Arrow Navigation
1. Press **Up Arrow** - should show `ls -la`
2. Press **Up Arrow** - should show `pwd`
3. Press **Up Arrow** - should show `echo "third command"`
4. Press **Up Arrow** - should show `echo "second command"`
5. Press **Up Arrow** - should show `echo "first command"`

### Step 4: Test Down Arrow Navigation
1. Press **Down Arrow** - should show `echo "second command"`
2. Press **Down Arrow** - should show `echo "third command"`
3. Press **Down Arrow** - should show `pwd`
4. Press **Down Arrow** - should show `ls -la`
5. Press **Down Arrow** - should clear the line (past newest entry)

### Step 5: Test Mixed Navigation
1. Press **Up Arrow** twice to get to `pwd`
2. Press **Down Arrow** once to get to `ls -la`
3. Press **Enter** to execute the command
4. Press **Up Arrow** - should show `ls -la` again

## Expected Behavior (Fixed)
- ✅ **No character duplication** during history navigation
- ✅ **Clean display updates** when switching between history entries
- ✅ **Proper cursor positioning** after history selection
- ✅ **Stable terminal output** without corruption artifacts
- ✅ **Error recovery** activates if display issues occur

## Previous Broken Behavior (Should be Fixed)
- ❌ Character duplication when navigating history
- ❌ Display corruption during history updates
- ❌ Terminal artifacts when switching between entries
- ❌ Inconsistent cursor positioning

## Debug Output to Look For
With `LLE_DEBUG=1`, you should see:
```
[LLE_STABILIZATION] Error recovery triggered, code=-1, strategy=X
```
This indicates the stabilization system is working correctly.

## Technical Details
The fix integrates history navigation with the LLE-R002 Display System Stabilization by:
1. **Using error recovery** instead of direct fallback to `lle_display_render()`
2. **Leveraging stabilization metrics** for reliable display updates
3. **Providing graceful degradation** if stabilization fails

## Success Criteria
- ✅ History navigation works without visual artifacts
- ✅ Display updates are smooth and reliable
- ✅ No regression in existing functionality
- ✅ Error recovery system activates appropriately

## If Issues Persist
1. Check that display stabilization is properly initialized
2. Verify that `lle_display_error_recovery()` is being called
3. Look for error messages in debug output
4. Test on both macOS and Linux systems

## File Modified
- `src/line_editor/line_editor.c` - Added stabilization integration to history navigation

This completes LLE-R003: History Navigation Recovery as part of Phase R2 Core Functionality Restoration.

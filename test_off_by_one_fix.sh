echo "Testing the restored cursor repositioning logic with off-by-one correction."

# Build first
echo "Building LLE..."

echo "=== Test Setup ==="
echo "- Restored comprehensive cursor repositioning logic"
echo "- Added off-by-one fix: chars_to_move_back-- when > 0"
echo "- Removed excessive debug logging for clean testing"
echo

echo "=== Quick Automated Test ==="
meson test -C builddir test_backspace_enhancement test_backspace_logic
echo

echo "=== Manual Test Instructions ==="
echo
echo "1. Run: ./builddir/lusush"
echo "2. Type a command that wraps to second line:"
echo "   echo this_is_a_long_command_that_should_wrap_to_the_next_line"
echo "3. Press backspace repeatedly across the line wrap boundary"
echo "4. Continue until backspace stops working"
echo "5. Check final cursor position:"
echo "   ✅ GOOD: Cursor right after prompt, ready for new input"
echo "   ❌ BAD: Cursor on last character of prompt (one space too far back)"
echo

echo "=== What's Different This Time ==="
echo "- Restored the cursor repositioning logic that was closest to working"
echo "- Applied off-by-one fix: reduced chars_to_move_back by 1"
echo "- This should prevent the 'one space too far back' issue"
echo "- Boundary crossing detection and redraw logic unchanged"
echo

echo "=== Debug Mode (Optional) ==="
echo "For minimal debug output if needed:"
echo "export LLE_DEBUG=1"
echo "./builddir/lusush"
echo

echo "Test script ready! ✅"

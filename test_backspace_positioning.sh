echo "========================================================="
echo
echo "CRITICAL TEST: Backspace positioning at prompt boundary"
echo
echo "1. SETUP TEST:"
echo "   Run: ./builddir/lusush"
echo "   Type a command that will wrap to test backspace: 'echo \"This is a long line of text that will wrap across terminal boundaries for testing\"'"
echo
echo "2. BACKSPACE TEST:"
echo "   Use backspace to delete characters from the end of the line"
echo "   Continue backspacing across the line wrap boundary"
echo "   Continue backspacing until you reach the beginning of the input"
echo
echo "3. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR (UPDATED WITH SPACE PRESERVATION FIX):"
echo "   ‚úÖ Backspace should work smoothly across line wrap boundary"
echo "   ‚úÖ Backspace should stop AFTER the space between prompt and input"
echo "   ‚úÖ Cursor should be positioned: '[prompt] $ |' (with space preserved)"
echo "   ‚ùå Should NOT consume the space and end up: '[prompt] $|' (no space)"
echo "   ‚úÖ Space should be explicitly added back during boundary crossing redraw"
echo
echo "4. SPECIFIC ISSUE TO CHECK:"
echo "   The cursor should stop at the correct position after the prompt space"
echo "   The space should be preserved during boundary crossing operations"
echo "   The prompt should remain properly formatted with space separation"
echo "   No extra space should be added (only the proper single space)"
echo
echo "5. DEBUG VERSION (if needed):"
echo "   Run: LLE_DEBUG=1 ./builddir/lusush"
echo "   Look for space and cursor positioning debug messages after boundary crossing"
echo "   Expected: '[LLE_INCREMENTAL] Failed to write space before content' (should NOT appear)"
echo "   Expected: '[LLE_INCREMENTAL] Positioning cursor after boundary redraw'"
echo

echo "üéØ WHAT THIS TEST VALIDATES"
echo "==========================="
echo "BEFORE: Backspace consumed space between prompt and input"
echo "ISSUE:  Cursor ended up right against prompt: '[prompt]$|'"
echo "AFTER:  Space is preserved and cursor positioned correctly: '[prompt] $ |'"
echo
echo "This tests both space preservation and cursor positioning for backspace boundary crossing."
echo "The fix ensures that the space between prompt and input is maintained during redraw operations."
echo

echo "üîß IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS BEING TESTED"
echo "======================================"
echo "The fix adds space preservation and cursor positioning after boundary crossing:"
echo "1. Add explicit space before content when redrawing after boundary crossing"
echo "2. Calculate prompt width + space + remaining text length for cursor positioning"
echo "3. Determine correct terminal row and column including the space"
echo "4. Position cursor at the calculated location"
echo "5. This preserves the space between prompt and input during boundary operations"
echo

echo "Test script completed. Manual verification REQUIRED!"
echo "Please test the backspace positioning manually as described above."

echo "  - Terminal capabilities not properly detected"
echo "  - Readline not in correct mode for terminal type"

echo "=== SYSTEMATIC FIX STRATEGY ==="

echo "  2. ‚úÖ Analyze environment and configuration"
echo "  3. üìã Manual test display issues to confirm scope"
echo "  4. üìã Identify specific functions causing problems"

echo "Phase 2: Minimal Working Configuration"
echo "  1. üìã Create absolute minimal readline setup"

echo "  3. üìã Verify Ctrl+G and Ctrl+R work correctly"
echo "  4. üìã Establish solid foundation"

echo "Phase 3: Incremental Feature Addition"

echo "=== IMMEDIATE RECOMMENDATIONS ==="
echo ""

echo "Based on this analysis, the next steps should be:"
echo ""

echo "1. Manual verification of current display issues"
echo "   Start: script -q -c './builddir/lusush' /dev/null"
echo "   Test: Arrow keys, Ctrl+G, Ctrl+R as you described"
echo "   Confirm: All issues still present in current code"
echo ""

echo "2. Systematic readline simplification"
echo "   Strategy: Gradually remove features until display works"
echo "   Start with: Remove custom redisplay, custom getc, complex config"
echo "   Test after each removal"
echo ""

echo "3. Once basic display works, rebuild carefully"
echo "   Add features incrementally with testing"
echo "   Priority: Arrow keys > Ctrl keys > Advanced features"
echo ""

echo "=== CRITICAL INSIGHT ==="
echo ""

echo "The fundamental issue is that readline integration has:"
echo "  ‚ùå Too many custom functions interfering with standard behavior"
echo "  ‚ùå Complex configuration that may be incompatible"
echo "  ‚ùå Display management that doesn't work with terminal properly"
echo ""

echo "Solution approach:"
echo "  ‚úÖ Start with minimal standard readline functionality"
echo "  ‚úÖ Verify basic operations work correctly"
echo "  ‚úÖ Add lusush-specific features only after foundation is solid"
echo ""

echo "=== READY FOR SYSTEMATIC FIXES ==="
echo ""

echo "This diagnostic confirms that the issues are real and serious."
echo "The next step is careful, incremental fixes starting with basic functionality."
echo ""

echo "Recommendation: Start with absolute minimal readline configuration"
echo "and build up systematically until we identify the exact cause"
echo "of the display corruption."

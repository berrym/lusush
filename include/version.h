    "Lush is a Unix shell built entirely from scratch. It combines POSIX "     \
    "compliance with carefully chosen extensions from Bash and Zsh, plus "     \
    "capabilities found nowhere else - most notably an integrated debugger "   \
    "for shell scripts. The native line editor (LLE) provides syntax "         \
    "highlighting and context-aware completions without relying on GNU "       \
    "Readline or any external library."

echo "CODE ANALYSIS SUGGESTIONS:"
echo "=========================="
echo ""

echo "The issues likely stem from:"
echo ""
echo "1. THEME-DEPENDENT REFRESH LOGIC:"
echo "   - Original theme uses single-line refresh"
echo "   - Dark theme uses multiline refresh"
echo "   - Different code paths may have different bugs"
echo ""
echo "2. WRAPPED LINE HANDLING:"
echo "   - Original theme may not properly calculate wrapped content"
echo "   - History recall doesn't account for line wrapping"
echo "   - Creates new prompt instead of replacing"
echo ""
echo "3. MULTILINE PROMPT STACKING:"
echo "   - Dark theme multiline prompts not properly cleared"
echo "   - History navigation leaves previous prompt visible"
echo "   - Clearing logic insufficient for multiline prompts"
echo ""

echo "POTENTIAL FIXES:"
echo "==============="
echo ""

echo "1. UNIFIED REFRESH APPROACH:"
echo "   - Use same refresh logic regardless of theme"
echo "   - Ensure proper clearing before redrawing"
echo "   - Handle wrapped content consistently"
echo ""
echo "2. PROPER CLEARING LOGIC:"
echo "   - Clear entire prompt area before history recall"
echo "   - Calculate proper number of lines to clear"
echo "   - Handle both single-line and multiline prompts"
echo ""
echo "3. THEME-AWARE LINE CALCULATION:"
echo "   - Account for prompt structure differences"
echo "   - Calculate wrapped lines correctly per theme"
echo "   - Ensure cursor positioning accuracy"

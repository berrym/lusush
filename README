LUSUSH

==== OVERVIEW

    Lusush is a shell for the UNIX environment.  It is simple and essentially
    featureless.  Originally developed as an educational experience to gain
    more familiarity with programming in a UNIX environment, that is what the
    project remains today.

    Lusush is useless for most people.  It has no job control, no scripting,
    and basically lacks most features that people require from a shell.  It
    is however a lightweight alternative to shells with those features, and
    does it's job well.

    Should anybody find lusush or it's source code useful, perhaps as a How
    Not To guide, please let me know.

==== INSTALLATION

    Basic installation can be achieved with the following commands.

    ./configure
    make install

    Optionally configure can take some arguments that you may want to set.
    For example you may want to tell it where to look for libraries.
    On my NetBSD machine I would give it something that looked like this so
    that I can link readline into lusush.

    ./configure LDFLAGS+="-L/usr/pkg/lib -R/usr/pkg/lib"

    This will put the binary lusush in the top level directory where you can
    move it to any site specific location you so desire.

==== BASIC USAGE

    Lusus can be run as a login shell or interactively.  You type commands
    and lusush will attempt to locate them, then execute them.

    If you wish to use the redirection feature of lusush, it's the same as
    typical shell convention except that you are required to leave no space
    between the redirection symbol and the requisite file name.  This is
    because of the limited nature of lusush's parser.

    e.g. /home/you% ls >tmp
         /home/you% cat <tmp >tmp2

    NOT  /home/you% ls > tmp
         /home/you% cat < tmp > tmp2

LUSUSH

    Lusush is a shell for the UNIX environment.  It is simple and essentially
    featurless.  Originally developed as an educational experience to gain
    more familiarity with programming in a UNIX environment, that is what the
    project remains today.

    Lusush is useless for most people.  It has no job control, no scripting,
    and basically lacks most features that people require from a shell.  It
    is however a lightweight alternative to shells with those features, and
    does it's job well.

    Should anybody find lusush or it's sourcecode usefull, perhaps as a How
    Not To guide, please let me know.

### 4. **Build System Integration**
- ✅ Meson build system properly configured for readline dependency
- ✅ Clean compilation with all warnings addressed
- ✅ Proper library linking and dependency management

## 🚀 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Core Components

1. **`src/readline_integration.c`** - Complete readline wrapper system
   - History management with deduplication
   - Tab completion integration
   - Prompt generation with theme support
   - Key binding configuration
   - Signal handling

2. **`src/input.c`** - Unified input system
   - Interactive mode using readline
   - Non-interactive mode for script execution
   - Multiline parsing and continuation
   - State management for complex commands

3. **`include/readline_integration.h`** - Comprehensive API
   - Full readline feature exposure
   - Legacy compatibility layer
   - Hook system for extensibility

### Key Features Implemented

#### **History Management**
```c
// Automatic deduplication based on config.history_no_dups
void lusush_history_add(const char *line);
void lusush_history_save(void);
bool lusush_history_load(void);
```

#### **Tab Completion**
```c
// Seamless integration with existing completion system
void lusush_completion_setup(void);
char **lusush_completion_matches(const char *text, int start, int end);
```

#### **Prompt Integration**
```c
// Dynamic prompt generation with theme support
char *lusush_generate_prompt(void);
void lusush_prompt_update(void);
```

#### **Multiline Support**
```c
// Intelligent multiline parsing for complex commands
char *ln_gets(void);  // Interactive with readline
char *get_unified_input(FILE *in);  // Unified interface
```

## 🔧 CONFIGURATION

### Readline Features
- **Emacs mode**: Default key bindings (Ctrl+A/E/L/U/K/W)
- **Vi mode**: Ready for future implementation
- **Tab completion**: Integrated with Lusush completion engine
- **History**: Persistent history with configurable size and deduplication
- **Multiline**: Automatic detection and continuation prompts

### Key Bindings
- `Tab` - Tab completion
- `Ctrl+A` - Beginning of line
- `Ctrl+E` - End of line
- `Ctrl+L` - Clear screen
- `Ctrl+U` - Kill line backward
- `Ctrl+K` - Kill line forward
- `Ctrl+W` - Kill word backward
- `Ctrl+R` - Reverse history search (built-in readline feature)

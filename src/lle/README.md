# LLE (Lusush Line Editor) - Fresh Start Implementation

**Started**: 2025-10-18  
**Approach**: Clean implementation following specifications with enforced safeguards  
**Previous Implementation**: Deleted via nuclear option (see tag: lle-pre-nuclear-snapshot)

---

## Nuclear Option - Why Fresh Start?

Previous implementation (24,626 lines, 87 files) was fundamentally compromised:
- **333 placeholder markers** throughout codebase (TODO_SPEC, "Phase 2 will...", etc.)
- **Architectural violations** (direct terminal writes in display.c)
- **Compliance theater** (integration files with all NULL pointers)
- **Deceptive code** (comments claiming integration while doing opposite)
- **Inadequate testing** (32/32 tests passing with 25% actual functionality)

**Audit Results**: Zero components salvageable - all had violations or excessive placeholders.

**Decision**: Total nuclear option - delete everything, start completely fresh.

---

## Development Principles (MANDATORY - Zero Exceptions)

### 1. No Direct Terminal Control
- ✅ All rendering through Lusush display_controller
- ❌ No `write()` to terminal fd
- ❌ No escape sequences in LLE code
- **Enforcement**: `./scripts/lle_architectural_compliance_check.sh` must pass

### 2. No Placeholder Code
- ❌ No "For now..." comments
- ❌ No "Phase 2 will..." promises
- ❌ No TODO markers for core functionality
- **Rule**: Complete implementation or don't commit

### 3. Specification Compliance
- Follow corresponding spec exactly
- All required structures/functions implemented
- No invented simplifications
- **Reference**: docs/lle_specification/

### 4. Behavior Validation
- Tests validate what user SEES, not memory state
- Manual testing required per TESTING_STANDARDS.md
- Screenshot/video evidence for visual features
- **No "32/32 passing" with broken functionality**

### 5. Living Documents Synchronized
- Update handoff document with progress
- Run compliance check before commits
- No divergence between docs and reality
- **Check**: `./scripts/living_documents_compliance_check.sh`

---

## Active Safeguards

- ✅ `./scripts/lle_architectural_compliance_check.sh` - Detects violations
- ✅ `.git/hooks/pre-commit` - Blocks bad commits  
- ✅ `./scripts/living_documents_compliance_check.sh` - Enforces doc sync
- ✅ `docs/lle_implementation/TESTING_STANDARDS.md` - Quality requirements

## Implementation Roadmap

### Week 1: Terminal Capability Detection (CRITICAL FIRST STEP)

**Why First**: Everything else adapts to terminal capabilities

**Deliverable**: Fast capability detection system
- Environment variables ($TERM, $COLORTERM)
- ioctl for terminal size (TIOCGWINSZ)
- Optional capability probing (50ms timeout)
- Conservative fallback for unresponsive terminals
- **Must complete in <50ms**

**Specs**: 02 (Terminal Abstraction), 26 (Adaptive Terminal Integration)

**Quality Gate**:
- [ ] Detects capabilities correctly on 5+ terminal types
- [ ] Never blocks (always has fallback)
- [ ] Stores in internal state (never queries again)
- [ ] Compliance check passes
- [ ] Screenshot evidence per terminal type

---

### Week 2: Display Integration (USES WEEK 1 CAPABILITIES)

**Deliverable**: Rendering through Lusush display system
- Adapts to capabilities from Week 1
- Routes through display_controller
- 256-color vs 16-color based on detection
- Proper composition engine integration

**Spec**: 08 (Display Integration)

**Quality Gate**:
- [ ] Zero direct terminal writes
- [ ] Compliance check passes
- [ ] Manual test in 5+ terminals shows adaptive rendering
- [ ] Screenshot evidence
- [ ] User can see rendered text

---

### Week 3: Buffer Management

**Deliverable**: Working gap buffer with undo/redo
- Clean implementation (no salvaged code)
- UTF-8 support
- Proper memory management

**Spec**: 03 (Buffer Management)

---

### Week 4: Input Processing

**Deliverable**: Event-driven input handling
- UTF-8 parsing
- Key sequence detection
- Integration with buffer

**Spec**: 06 (Input Processing)

---

### Week 5: Editor Coordination

**Deliverable**: Cohesive editor
- Coordinates all subsystems
- Buffer + Display + Terminal + Input

---

### Week 6: Shell Integration

**Deliverable**: User-accessible LLE
- `display lle enable` command
- `display lle disable` command  
- Automatic fallback to GNU Readline
- Real-world user acceptance testing

**This is when LLE becomes usable**

---

## Quality Gates (Before Marking ANY Feature Complete)

- [ ] Specification compliance verified
- [ ] Architectural compliance check passes
- [ ] Tests validate behavior (not just state)
- [ ] Manual testing in real terminal complete
- [ ] Evidence documented (screenshots/video)
- [ ] Living documents updated
- [ ] User acceptance obtained

---

## What We Learned (From Failed Implementation)

### How Implementation Failed

1. **Prototype code became "final"**
   - Code marked "Phase 2 will integrate" never got integrated
   - "For now" code became permanent
   - Result: 333 placeholder markers

2. **Tests validated wrong things**
   - Checked memory state, not behavior
   - 32/32 passing while display was broken
   - No manual validation required

3. **Compliance was theater**
   - Files existed to pass checks (all NULL pointers)
   - Had right types but did nothing
   - Comments lied about what code did

4. **No enforcement**
   - Protocols existed but were ignored
   - Living documents diverged from reality
   - No automated checking during development

### How We Prevent It This Time

1. **Safeguards from commit 1**
   - Compliance checks run automatically
   - Pre-commit hooks block violations
   - No code commits without passing checks

2. **Behavior validation required**
   - Tests must validate what you SEE
   - Manual testing mandatory
   - Evidence required (screenshots/video)

3. **No placeholder code allowed**
   - Complete implementation or don't commit
   - No "Phase 2" promises
   - No TODO markers for core features

4. **Living documents enforced**
   - Compliance check before commits
   - Mandatory end-of-session checklist
   - Automatic detection of inconsistencies

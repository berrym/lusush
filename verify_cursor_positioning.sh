echo "This script will help you verify that the backspace boundary crossing fix"
echo "correctly positions the cursor at the beginning of input area (not at the"
echo "final character of the prompt)."

echo "=== Test Instructions ==="
echo
echo "1. The shell will start with a test prompt"
echo "2. Type a LONG command that will wrap across multiple lines"
echo "3. Press backspace repeatedly to delete characters"
echo "4. Pay attention when backspace crosses the line wrap boundary"
echo "5. Continue pressing backspace until it stops working"
echo "6. VERIFY: Cursor should be positioned right after the prompt"
echo "7. VERIFY: Prompt should be completely intact"
echo "8. Type 'exit' to finish the test"
echo

echo "=== Expected Behavior ==="
echo "✅ Backspace works normally until crossing line wrap boundary"
echo "✅ When crossing boundary, system redraws prompt and content"
echo "✅ Cursor is repositioned correctly within the remaining text"
echo "✅ When all text is deleted, cursor stops at beginning of input area"
echo "✅ Prompt characters are never consumed by backspace"
echo "✅ Final cursor position is right after the prompt, ready for new input"
echo

echo "=== Test Cases to Try ==="
echo "1. Long command: echo this_is_a_very_long_command_that_should_wrap_across_lines_when_terminal_is_narrow"
echo "2. Multiline command: for i in {1..100}; do echo \$i; done"
echo "3. Path command: cd /very/long/path/that/might/wrap/across/terminal/lines/depending/on/width"
echo

echo "=== What to Look For ==="
echo "❌ BAD: Cursor ends up on the final character of the prompt (like the '$' or '>')"
echo "✅ GOOD: Cursor is positioned right after the prompt, ready for new input"
echo "❌ BAD: Backspace deletes prompt characters"
echo "✅ GOOD: Backspace stops cleanly at beginning of input"
echo

echo "Press Enter to start the interactive test..."

echo "=== Test Complete ==="
echo "Did the cursor positioning work correctly?"
echo "- Was the cursor positioned right after the prompt when backspace stopped?"
echo "- Were prompt characters protected from backspace?"
echo "- Did the fix handle line wrap boundaries correctly?"
echo
echo "If you found issues, please report:"
echo "1. What prompt format you used"
echo "2. What command you typed"
echo "3. Where the cursor ended up vs where it should be"
echo "4. Any debug output that seemed relevant"

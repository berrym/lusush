# Lusush Shell Development Roadmap

## Current State Assessment
- âœ… Enhanced multi-token pushback system
- âœ… Basic POSIX control structures (if/then/else, for, while, until, case)
- âœ… Core builtins (echo, export, source, test, read, eval, etc.)
- âœ… Input buffering and completion detection
- âœ… Command line completion with linenoise
- âœ… Word expansion and pathname expansion
- âœ… Professional build system and versioning
- âœ… **Variable assignment and expansion system** - COMPLETED (all patterns work)
- âœ… **Scanner token typing fix** - CRITICAL BUG RESOLVED
- âœ… **Semicolon command separation** - WORKING (echo a; echo b)
- âœ… **Logical operators (&&, ||)** - COMPLETELY WORKING with proper short-circuit semantics
- âœ… **Multi-character operator parsing** - Scanner properly handles `&&`, `||`, `>>`, etc.
- âœ… **Pipeline vs logical operator separation** - Proper routing to correct execution systems

## ðŸŽ¯ MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: Mixed Operators Completely Fixed âœ…

**CRITICAL ACHIEVEMENT**: Mixed operator parsing now works perfectly - `cmd | pipe && logical` expressions functional

**Technical Solution Implemented**:
- **Modified `is_command_delimiter()`**: Excluded TOKEN_PIPE to prevent premature command splitting
- **Enhanced `parse_simple_command()`**: Added explicit NODE_PIPE creation for pipe tokens
- **Improved `execute_command()`**: Added pipeline detection and routing to execute_pipeline_from_node
- **Robust architecture**: Proper separation between pipeline and logical operator execution

**Real-World Impact**: Complex expressions like `echo test | grep test && echo found` now work correctly

**Previous Limitations RESOLVED**:
- âœ… **Mixed operators** - `echo test | grep test || echo not_found` - NOW WORKING
- âœ… **Pipeline + logical combinations** - Commands like `cmd1 | cmd2 && cmd3` - NOW WORKING  
- âœ… **Proper operator precedence** - Pipes execute before logical operators - NOW WORKING

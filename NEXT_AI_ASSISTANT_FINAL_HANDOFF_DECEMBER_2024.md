4. **Async Operations**: Non-blocking completion for network resources

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS

### DO NOT BREAK THESE WORKING FEATURES
1. **Arrow key history navigation** - Core user requirement (UP/DOWN arrows)
2. **Themed prompt display** - Beautiful multi-line prompts
3. **Display stability** - Zero ANSI artifacts or corruption
4. **Basic command execution** - All shell operations
5. **Theme switching** - `theme set dark` functionality

### Files That MUST Remain Stable
```
src/readline_integration.c  - Lines 774-776: Critical arrow key protection settings
src/themes.c               - Lines 1273, 1047, 1592: RESET codes with escape markers
src/prompt.c               - Line 143: RESET with escape markers intact
```

### Critical Configuration to Preserve (WORKING PERFECTLY)
```c
// These settings enable TAB completion while protecting arrow keys:
rl_attempted_completion_function = lusush_tab_completion;  // ✅ TAB completion enabled
rl_variable_bind("show-all-if-ambiguous", "off");         // ✅ Protects arrow keys
rl_variable_bind("show-all-if-unmodified", "off");        // ✅ Prevents completion menu
rl_variable_bind("disable-completion", "off");            // ✅ Enables TAB completion
```

---

## 🧪 MANDATORY TESTING PROTOCOL

### Before ANY Changes
**ALWAYS verify current functionality**:
```bash
cd lusush
script -q -c './builddir/lusush' /dev/null

# These MUST work:
1. theme set dark           # Should show beautiful themed prompt
2. echo hello + UP arrow    # Should navigate to history entry cleanly
3. echo world + DOWN arrow  # Should navigate history without artifacts  
4. Ctrl+L                   # Should clear screen completely
5. Ctrl+G (on typed text)   # Should clear current line
```

### Development Methodology That Works
1. **One change at a time** - Never modify multiple systems simultaneously
2. **Build immediately** - `ninja -C builddir` after each change
3. **Manual interactive testing** - Automated tests miss display issues
4. **User feedback confirmation** - Essential for interactive features
5. **Preserve working functionality** - Never break existing features

---

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Current Build System
```bash
# Build command
ninja -C builddir

# Interactive testing (essential)
script -q -c './builddir/lusush' /dev/null
```

### Key Working Functions (DO NOT MODIFY)
```c
// Working key bindings in setup_key_bindings()
rl_bind_key(7, lusush_abort_line);                 // Ctrl-G: working
rl_bind_key(12, lusush_clear_screen_and_redisplay); // Ctrl-L: working
rl_bind_key(16, lusush_previous_history);           // Ctrl-P: working
rl_bind_key(14, lusush_next_history);               // Ctrl-N: working

// Working configuration in setup_readline_config()
rl_redisplay_function = rl_redisplay;  // Standard redisplay only
```

### Recent Fixes Applied (Preserve These)
1. **RESET Code Escape Markers**: All `\033[0m` codes now use `\001\033[0m\002`
2. **Custom Redisplay Disabled**: Prevents display corruption during Ctrl+R
3. **Completion System Disabled**: Prevents arrow key interference

---

## 📋 CURRENT MINOR ISSUES (ACCEPTABLE)

### Ctrl+R Reverse Search
**Status**: Functional with minor cosmetic positioning issue  
**Behavior**: Search prompt appears on same line as first line of multi-line prompt  
**User Decision**: Acceptable - functionality works perfectly, cosmetics minor  
**Action**: No changes needed - focus on higher priorities  

---

## 🚀 SUCCESS ROADMAP

1. **Tab Completion**: Re-enable without breaking arrow keys
2. **Syntax Highlighting**: Implement basic real-time highlighting  
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive verification of all features
4. **Documentation**: Update user-facing docs with new capabilities

### Success Criteria
- ✅ TAB key provides file/command completion

// Enhance existing working completion:
1. Add context-aware completion based on command type
2. Integrate history completion for recent commands
3. Implement command-specific completion handlers
4. Add smart filtering and ranking algorithms
5. Maintain current performance and arrow key protection
```

### Additional Themes Strategy
```c
// Expand theme system:
1. Implement light theme for bright environments
2. Create minimal theme for focused work

Repository Cleanup Summary - 2025-10-20
========================================

CLEANUP COMPLETED:
------------------

1. Deleted Build Artifacts:
   - 212 .o object files removed
   - 1 valgrind core dump (vgcore.309582, 6.4MB) removed
   - audit_execution.log removed

2. Organized Documentation Structure:
   Created docs/archived/ with subdirectories:
   - nuclear_options/ (1 file)
   - phase_completions/ (3 files)
   - spec_audits/ (2 files)
   - spec_extractions/ (5 files)

3. Moved Files (using git mv for traceability):
   - 11 historical markdown files to docs/archived/
   - 1 policy document to docs/lle_implementation/
   - 1 test script to scripts/

4. Root Directory Status:
   NOW: Only 9 essential files remain:
   - AI_ASSISTANT_HANDOFF_DOCUMENT.md (central nervous system - NEVER MOVE)
   - README.md (project introduction)
   - meson.build (build configuration)
   - .gitignore, .editorconfig, .clang-format (project config)
   - .cursorrules (AI assistant rules)
   - LICENSE (project license)

VERIFICATION:
-------------
✅ AI_ASSISTANT_HANDOFF_DOCUMENT.md verified as ONLY handoff doc in repo
✅ AI_ASSISTANT_HANDOFF_DOCUMENT.md remains in root (central hub)
✅ All moved files tracked with git mv (full history preserved)
✅ No references to moved documents found in active code
✅ Build artifacts completely removed
✅ Root directory is clean and maintainable

POLICY GOING FORWARD:
---------------------
1. AI_ASSISTANT_HANDOFF_DOCUMENT.md MUST remain in root
2. Only essential project files should be in root
3. Documentation belongs in docs/ subdirectories
4. Historical/completed documents go to docs/archived/
5. Build artifacts (.o, core dumps) should never be committed
6. Test scripts belong in scripts/

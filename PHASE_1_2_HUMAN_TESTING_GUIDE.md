# Phase 1 & 2 Boundary Crossing Fixes - Human Testing Guide

**Date**: December 31, 2024  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Human verification required before Phase 3  
**Status**: Phase 1 & 2 implementation complete, awaiting human validation  
**Estimated Testing Time**: 30-45 minutes  

## üéØ Testing Objective

Verify that the **Phase 1 Mathematical Framework Fixes** and **Phase 2 Handler Consolidation** have successfully resolved the boundary crossing issues documented in the AI_CONTEXT.md:

- ‚úÖ **Phase 1**: Visual footprint calculation errors fixed
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2**: Duplicate boundary crossing handlers consolidated
- ‚ùì **Human Verification Required**: Do the fixes actually work in real-world usage?

## üö® Critical Issues Being Tested

### **Issue 1: "Double-Deletion" Visual Glitch**
**Before Fix**: User presses backspace once, appears to delete 2+ characters
**Expected After Fix**: Each backspace deletes exactly one character visually

### **Issue 2: Cursor Positioning Errors** 
**Before Fix**: Cursor positioned at wrong location after boundary crossing (end_col=120+)
**Expected After Fix**: Cursor positioned correctly within terminal width bounds

### **Issue 3: Buffer Content Echoing**
**Before Fix**: Remaining buffer content echoes to terminal during boundary crossing
**Expected After Fix**: Clean boundary crossing without content echoing

### **Issue 4: Multiple Handler Conflicts**
**Before Fix**: Two boundary crossing systems causing state inconsistencies
**Expected After Fix**: Single, reliable boundary crossing behavior

## üõ†Ô∏è Test Environment Setup

### **Prerequisites**
```bash
# 1. Build latest version with Phase 1 & 2 fixes
cd lusush
scripts/lle_build.sh build

# 2. Enable debug mode for detailed logging
export LLE_DEBUG=1
export LLE_DEBUG_CURSOR=1

# 3. Set up test terminal (recommended: iTerm2 or standard terminal)
# Ensure terminal width is 120 columns for consistency with documented issues
```

### **Terminal Configuration**
- **Width**: 120 columns (critical for reproducing boundary crossing)
- **Height**: 24+ rows (sufficient for multi-line content)
- **Font**: Monospace (ensures accurate character width calculations)

## üß™ Critical Test Scenarios

### **Test Scenario 1: Basic Boundary Crossing (CRITICAL)**

**Test Steps**:
1. Launch shell: `./builddir/lusush`
2. Type the **exact command from documentation**:
   ```
   echo "This is a very long command that will definitely wrap across multiple lines when typed in a standard terminal width and should trigger the line wrap backspace logic when deleted"
   ```
3. **Verify**: Command wraps across multiple lines (should wrap at column 120)
4. **Critical Test**: Use backspace to delete characters **across the line wrap boundary**
5. **Continue**: Backspace all the way until empty (cursor should end up after prompt)

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Each backspace deletes exactly **one character** (no "double deletion")
- ‚úÖ Cursor positioning is mathematically correct during boundary crossing
- ‚úÖ No buffer content echoing to terminal
- ‚úÖ Smooth, consistent behavior throughout entire deletion process
- ‚úÖ Final cursor position: immediately after prompt (not on last prompt character)

**Debug Log Evidence to Look For**:
```
[LLE_BOUNDARY_VALIDATION] Validation passed: crossing=true, after_rows=1, after_col=XX
[LLE_UNIFIED_BOUNDARY] Processing boundary crossing: 2‚Üí1 rows, wrap: true‚Üífalse
[LLE_UNIFIED_BOUNDARY] Boundary crossing completed successfully
```

### **Test Scenario 2: Multiple Boundary Crossings**

**Test Steps**:
1. Type a **very long command** that wraps multiple lines:
   ```
   find /usr/local -name "*.so" -exec ls -la {} \; | grep -E "(lib|bin)" | head -20 | sort | uniq | xargs -I {} echo "Processing: {}" > /tmp/output.txt
   ```
2. Use backspace to cross **multiple line boundaries** during deletion
3. Continue editing after boundary crossings (add/remove characters)

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Consistent behavior across multiple boundary crossings
- ‚úÖ No cumulative errors or state corruption
- ‚úÖ Editing continues normally after boundary operations

### **Test Scenario 3: Edge Case - Prompt Width Validation**

**Test Steps**:
1. Test with different prompt configurations (if customizable)
2. Type content that creates **exactly terminal width** total content
3. Perform boundary crossing operations

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ No end_column calculations exceeding terminal width
- ‚úÖ Graceful handling of prompt + content = exactly terminal width

### **Test Scenario 4: Stress Test - Rapid Operations**

**Test Steps**:
1. Type long content that wraps
2. Perform **rapid backspace operations** across boundaries
3. Alternate between adding and removing characters across boundaries

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ No visual corruption under rapid operations
- ‚úÖ Consistent behavior regardless of operation speed
- ‚úÖ No accumulated errors or drift

## üîç Human Observer Checklist

### **Visual Behavior Validation**

**‚úÖ Character Deletion Accuracy**:
- [ ] Each backspace visibly deletes exactly one character
- [ ] No "jumping" or skipping of multiple characters
- [ ] Consistent deletion behavior at boundary crossings

**‚úÖ Cursor Positioning Accuracy**:
- [ ] Cursor always positioned correctly relative to text content
- [ ] No cursor positioned beyond terminal width
- [ ] Smooth cursor movement during boundary crossings
- [ ] Final position after complete deletion: right after prompt

**‚úÖ Visual Cleanliness**:
- [ ] No remnant characters or visual artifacts
- [ ] No flickering or redraw issues during boundary crossing
- [ ] Clean terminal output without corruption

**‚úÖ System Reliability**:
- [ ] No crashes or hangs during boundary operations
- [ ] Consistent behavior across multiple test runs
- [ ] Normal editing functionality preserved

### **Specific Issues to Watch For**

**‚ùå FAILURE INDICATORS (Report if observed)**:
- Backspace appears to delete 2+ characters in one operation
- Cursor positioned at column 120+ (beyond terminal width)
- Buffer content echoes to terminal during boundary crossing
- Visual artifacts or incomplete clearing
- Cursor positioned "on top of" last prompt character
- Inconsistent behavior between similar operations

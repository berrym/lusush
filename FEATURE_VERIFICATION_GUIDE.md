# Feature Verification Guide: Tab Completion and Syntax Highlighting

This guide helps verify that the newly implemented tab completion and syntax highlighting features are working correctly in Lusush.

## Overview

Two major interactive features have been implemented with partial functionality:

1. **Tab Completion**: Basic file completion for the current directory
2. **Syntax Highlighting**: Command highlighting (first word highlighting working)

Both features are enabled by default and provide basic functionality in interactive shell sessions.

**CURRENT STATUS:**
- Tab completion works for single matches, cycling through multiple matches needs debugging
- Syntax highlighting works for commands (turns first word blue), full syntax highlighting needs verification
- Framework is complete, core functionality is working, refinement needed for full feature set

## Prerequisites

- Build the latest version: `scripts/lle_build.sh build`
- Ensure you're in a directory with some files for testing tab completion
- Use a terminal that supports ANSI colors for syntax highlighting
- For debugging, use: `LLE_DEBUG=1 ./builddir/lusush`

## Testing Tab Completion

### Basic File Completion

1. **Start interactive shell:**
   ```bash
   ./builddir/lusush
   ```

2. **Test basic completion:**
   ```bash
   # Type this but don't press Enter - press Tab after the 't'
   echo t<TAB>
   ```
   **Expected:** Should complete to one of the files starting with 't' in current directory
   
   **CURRENT LIMITATION:** Only applies first match found, cycling not yet working

3. **Test prefix matching:**
   ```bash
   # If you have files like test_file.txt, test_completion.sh
   ls test_<TAB>
   ```
   **Expected:** Should complete to the first matching file
   
   **CURRENT LIMITATION:** Will always complete to same first match, not cycling through alternatives

4. **Test with longer prefixes:**
   ```bash
   cat test_file<TAB>
   ```
   **Expected:** Should complete to `test_file.txt` if it exists
   
   **CURRENT LIMITATION:** If multiple files match, only first one is shown

### Advanced Tab Completion Tests

5. **Test with hidden files (if any exist):**
   ```bash
   ls .<TAB>
   ```
   **Expected:** Should show hidden files starting with '.'

6. **Test with non-matching prefix:**
   ```bash
   echo nonexistent<TAB>
   ```
   **Expected:** Should do nothing (no completion available)

7. **Test in middle of command:**
   ```bash
   # Type this and press Tab after 'test_'
   cat test_<TAB> | grep hello
   ```
   **Expected:** Should complete the filename portion

## Testing Syntax Highlighting

Syntax highlighting applies colors in real-time as you type. **CURRENT STATUS:** Basic command highlighting working (first word turns blue).

Test these scenarios to see what's working:

### Basic Command Highlighting

1. **Simple command:**
   ```bash
   echo hello
   ```
   **Expected:** `echo` should be highlighted in blue (WORKING)

2. **String highlighting:**
   ```bash
   echo "hello world"
   ```
   **Expected:** `echo` highlighted in blue, quoted text may be highlighted (NEEDS VERIFICATION)

3. **Variable highlighting:**
   ```bash
   echo $HOME
   ```
   **Expected:** `echo` highlighted in blue, `$HOME` variable highlighting (NEEDS VERIFICATION)

### Advanced Syntax Highlighting

4. **Pipes and operators:**
   ```bash
   ls -la | grep test
   ```
   **Expected:** `ls` highlighted in blue, pipe operator highlighting (NEEDS VERIFICATION)

5. **Comments:**
   ```bash
   echo hello # this is a comment
   ```
   **Expected:** `echo` highlighted in blue, comment highlighting (NEEDS VERIFICATION)

6. **Complex command:**
   ```bash
   find /tmp -name "*.txt" | head -5
   ```
   **Expected:** `find` highlighted in blue, other syntax elements (NEEDS VERIFICATION)

## Troubleshooting

### Tab Completion Not Working

**Symptoms:** Pressing Tab does nothing or inserts literal tab character

**Checks:**
1. Verify you're in interactive mode (not piping input)
2. Check that files exist in current directory: `ls`
3. Enable debug mode: `LLE_DEBUG=1 ./builddir/lusush`

**Common Issues:**
- Non-interactive shell: Tab completion only works in interactive mode
- No matching files: Tab completion requires matching files in current directory
- Terminal compatibility: Ensure terminal supports raw mode

### Syntax Highlighting Not Working

**Symptoms:** No colors appear, all text looks the same

**Checks:**
1. Verify terminal supports colors: `echo -e "\033[31mRED\033[0m"`
2. Check if colors are enabled in terminal settings
3. Test with simple command like `echo hello`

**Common Issues:**
- Terminal doesn't support ANSI colors
- Color scheme conflicts with syntax highlighting colors  
- SSH sessions may disable colors by default

**CURRENT STATUS:** Basic command highlighting works and shows colors immediately. Full syntax highlighting framework implemented but needs verification for strings, variables, operators.

## Debug Mode

For detailed troubleshooting, enable debug output:

```bash
# Enable LLE debug output
LLE_DEBUG=1 ./builddir/lusush

# Enable integration debug output  
LLE_INTEGRATION_DEBUG=1 ./builddir/lusush
```

This will show detailed information about:
- LLE initialization
- Component setup (syntax highlighter, theme integration)
- Key input processing
- Display rendering

## Implementation Details

### Tab Completion
- Scans current directory for matching files
- Uses case-insensitive prefix matching
- Skips hidden files unless prefix starts with '.'
- Integrates with LLE completion framework
- Supports basic file completion (extensible to commands/variables)

### Syntax Highlighting
- Real-time highlighting as you type
- Supports shell keywords, strings, variables, comments, operators
- Integrates with LLE theme system for colors
- Uses efficient region-based highlighting
- Configurable syntax rules and color schemes

## Expected Behavior Summary

| Feature | Input | Expected Result | Current Status |
|---------|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Tab Completion | `echo t<TAB>` | Completes to matching filename | ‚úÖ WORKING |
| Tab Completion | `echo t<TAB><TAB>` | Cycles through multiple matches | ‚ùå CYCLING BROKEN |
| Tab Completion | `ls nonexist<TAB>` | No action (no matches) | ‚úÖ WORKING |
| Syntax Highlighting | `echo "hello"` | `echo` highlighted in blue | ‚úÖ COMMANDS WORKING |
| Syntax Highlighting | `ls | grep test` | Command highlighted | üîß NEEDS VERIFICATION |
| Syntax Highlighting | `echo $HOME` | Command highlighted | üîß NEEDS VERIFICATION |

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Tab Completion Basic:** Pressing Tab completes filenames when single match exists  
‚ùå **Tab Completion Cycling:** Multiple Tab presses should cycle through all matches (NOT WORKING)  
‚úÖ **Syntax Highlighting Basic:** Commands (first word) show blue color in real-time  
üîß **Syntax Highlighting Full:** Strings, variables, operators need verification  
‚úÖ **No Regressions:** Basic shell functionality still works normally  
‚úÖ **Performance:** No noticeable lag when typing or completing

## Next Steps

Current development status and next steps:

**Working Foundation:**
1. Tab completion framework complete, basic functionality working
2. Syntax highlighting framework complete, command highlighting working
3. Both features integrate properly with LLE framework

**Known Issues to Fix:**
1. Tab completion cycling through multiple matches
2. Full syntax highlighting verification for all shell constructs

**If you find additional issues, please report:**
- Terminal type and version
- Specific commands that fail
- Debug output (using `LLE_DEBUG=1`)
- Expected vs actual behavior

echo "✅ KEYBINDING FIXES IMPLEMENTED"
echo ""
echo "The following keybindings have been fixed:"
echo "  • Ctrl+A - Move cursor to beginning of line"
echo "  • Ctrl+E - Move cursor to end of line"
echo "  • Ctrl+U - Clear entire line"
echo "  • Ctrl+G - Cancel current line"
echo ""
echo "🎯 ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENTS:"
echo "  • Eliminated manual lle_terminal_* operations"
echo "  • All keybindings now use display system APIs"
echo "  • Display state consistency maintained"
echo "  • Immediate visual feedback enabled"
echo ""
echo "📋 MANUAL TESTING REQUIRED:"
echo "Run './builddir/lusush' in a terminal and test:"
echo "  1. Type some text, then press Ctrl+A (cursor should move to start)"
echo "  2. Press Ctrl+E (cursor should move to end)"
echo "  3. Press Ctrl+U (line should clear)"
echo "  4. Type text, press Ctrl+G (line should clear)"
echo ""
echo "Expected behavior: Immediate visual cursor movement and proper clearing"
echo ""
echo "🎉 Phase 2 keybinding reimplementation COMPLETE!"

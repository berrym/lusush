echo "  üîµ Keywords (BLUE):              if, then, else, for, while, do, done, etc."
echo "  üü° Strings (YELLOW):             \"hello world\", 'test', etc."
echo "  üü£ Variables (MAGENTA):          \$HOME, \$USER, \$PATH, etc."
echo "  üî¥ Operators (RED):              |, &, ;, <, >, etc."

echo "  üîµ Numbers (CYAN):               123, 45.67, etc."
echo
echo "Test Commands to Try:"
echo "---------------------"
echo "1. echo \"hello world\"              # Should show: echo(GREEN) \"hello world\"(YELLOW)"
echo "2. ls -la | grep test             # Should show: ls(GREEN) | (RED) grep(GREEN)"

echo "6. # this is a comment            # Should show: entire line in GRAY"

echo
echo "What to Look For:"
echo "----------------"
echo "‚úÖ GOOD: Actual colors appear as you type"
echo "‚ùå BAD:  Literal codes like ^[[1;32m or \\033[1;32m appear"
echo "‚ùå BAD:  No colors at all (everything appears in default terminal color)"
echo
echo "Special Features to Test:"
echo "------------------------"
echo "‚Ä¢ Tab completion should still work (try: ec<TAB>)"
echo "‚Ä¢ Arrow keys should navigate history"
echo "‚Ä¢ Ctrl+R should work for reverse search"
echo "‚Ä¢ Ctrl+L should clear screen"
echo "‚Ä¢ Ctrl+C should interrupt gracefully"
echo
echo "Starting interactive shell now..."
echo "Type 'exit' or press Ctrl+D to quit when done testing."

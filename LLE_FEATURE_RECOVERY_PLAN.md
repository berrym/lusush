# LLE Feature Recovery Plan - Systematic Restoration of Shell Functionality

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: January 31, 2025  
**Status**: ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT PLAN  
**Purpose**: Systematic recovery and implementation of essential shell features

## 🎯 **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

**CURRENT REALITY**: Despite extensive development, core shell features are non-functional due to platform-specific display system issues and integration failures. This plan provides a systematic approach to restore essential functionality.

**ROOT CAUSE**: Linux/Konsole character duplication issue (`lle_display_update_incremental()` platform differences) is blocking all interactive features. macOS/iTerm2 works, Linux systems completely broken.

**STRATEGY**: Fix foundation first, then systematically restore features in order of user importance.

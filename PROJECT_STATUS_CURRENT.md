### ðŸŽ¯ LATEST ACHIEVEMENT: POSIX-COMPLIANT BACKSLASH HANDLING (Current Session)

**POSIX COMPLIANCE BREAKTHROUGH**: Fixed double-quoted string backslash processing for proper regex alternation support

**Root Cause Identified and Resolved**:
- Double-quoted string processing incorrectly consumed backslashes in non-escape sequences
- Pattern `"builtin\|shell builtin"` was converted to `"builtin|shell builtin"` losing alternation syntax
- POSIX requires literal backslash preservation when not preceding recognized escape characters
- Grep regex alternation patterns failed due to improper backslash handling in shell quote processing

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Enhanced `expand_quoted_string()` backslash processing** for POSIX compliance
- Fixed default case to preserve both backslash and following character for non-escape sequences
- Removed premature pointer advancement causing character consumption
- Added proper buffer bounds checking for two-character literal preservation
- Maintains recognition of valid escape sequences: `$`, `` ` ``, `"`, `\`, newline

**POSIX Compliance Achievement**:
- **Literal Backslash Preservation**: `"test\|pattern"` now correctly outputs `"test\|pattern"`
- **Regex Alternation Support**: `grep -q "builtin\|shell builtin"` patterns work correctly
- **Standard Escape Sequences**: Valid escapes like `\"`, `\\`, `\$` still processed correctly
- **String Processing Integrity**: All existing quote processing functionality maintained

**Test Results**:

### ðŸŽ¯ PREVIOUS ACHIEVEMENT: LUSUSH-NATIVE COMMAND SUBSTITUTION

**ARCHITECTURAL BREAKTHROUGH**: Eliminated external shell dependency and implemented true lusush-native command substitution

**Root Cause Identified and Resolved**:
- Command substitution previously relied on `/bin/sh` violating architectural independence
- External shell dependency created inconsistent feature availability and system dependencies
- Lusush should be self-contained without relying on host shell implementations
- Function inheritance needed proper fork-based executor context preservation

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Replaced `/bin/sh` with lusush's own parser and executor** for true architectural consistency
- Fork child process with inherited executor context including all function definitions
- Use lusush `parser_new()` and `execute_node()` instead of `execl("/bin/sh")`
- Implement proper process synchronization with `waitpid()` before pipe reading
- Maintain pipe-based output capture with stdout flushing for reliable results

**Architectural Significance**:
- **Complete Shell Independence**: Lusush no longer depends on external shells
- **Consistent Feature Set**: All lusush features work identically in command substitution
- **Fork-based Inheritance**: Functions and variables properly inherited via process memory copying
- **Self-Contained Execution**: No external binary dependencies for core functionality

**Test Results**:
- Test 96 Function with output: **MAINTAINED** - `result=$(double 5); echo $result` returns `10` correctly
- Overall test success rate: **MAINTAINED at 95%** (129/136 tests)
- Function Operations category: **MAINTAINED at 100%** with native execution

### ðŸŽ¯ PREVIOUS ACHIEVEMENT: FILENAME GLOBBING EXPANSION

**BREAKTHROUGH**: Fixed fundamental tokenizer issue preventing glob pattern recognition

**Root Cause Identified and Resolved**:
- Tokenizer incorrectly treated `*` as `TOK_MULTIPLY` and `?` as `TOK_QUESTION` operators
- Parser failed with "Expected command name" error before glob expansion could occur
- Word character set excluded glob pattern characters `*, ?, [], `
- Comprehensive glob expansion infrastructure existed but was never reached

**Technical Implementation**:
- Enhanced `is_word_char()` function to include `*, ?, [, ]` in word token character set
- Modified tokenizer to allow glob patterns as part of `TOK_WORD` tokens
- Maintained arithmetic operator functionality for expressions in `$((...))` contexts
- Leveraged existing `expand_glob_pattern()` system call infrastructure

**Test Results**:
- Test 115 Asterisk glob: **FIXED** - `echo /tmp/test*$$` now returns `2` as expected
- Test 116 Question mark glob: **FIXED** - `echo /tmp/test?$$` now returns `2` as expected  
- Overall test success rate: **92% â†’ 94%** (126/136 â†’ 128/136 tests)
- Pattern Matching category: **16% â†’ 50%** with functional filename globbing
- All 49/49 POSIX regression tests maintained at 100%

**Files Modified**:
- `src/tokenizer.c`: Enhanced word character recognition and glob pattern tokenization

- **Impact**: Essential for shell scripting and POSIX compliance
- **Complexity**: Medium - requires fixing arithmetic parser and execution

#### 2. Command Substitution (BROKEN - Priority: CRITICAL)

- **Execution Speed**: Performance comparable to legacy implementation
- **Standards Compliance**: Excellent POSIX adherence with modern parser, case statements, and test builtin
- **Test Coverage**: 100% success rate on case statements, 94% on parameter expansion, 80% on functions (major breakthrough after regression fixes)

## Development Methodology

The project follows a gradual migration approach, maintaining full backward compatibility while introducing modern components. Each phase preserves existing functionality while adding new capabilities.

This approach has successfully delivered working simple commands, variable handling, pipeline execution, complete parameter expansion, and now full case statement support. The modern architecture provides a solid foundation for implementing remaining POSIX shell features.

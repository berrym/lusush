## Major Technical Achievements This Session

### Critical Fix #1: Read Builtin EOF Handling
- **Problem**: `read line < /dev/null` was outputting "read: end of file reached"
- **POSIX Requirement**: Read should return non-zero exit status on EOF without output
- **Solution**: Removed stderr output on EOF condition in bin_read function
- **Impact**: I/O Redirection category jumped to 100% completion
- **Files Modified**: `src/builtins/builtins.c`

### Critical Fix #2: External Command Error Codes
- **Problem**: Permission denied was returning 127 instead of 126
- **POSIX Requirement**: 126 = permission denied, 127 = command not found
- **Solution**: Added errno checking (EACCES vs ENOENT) in both execution paths
- **Impact**: Error handling improved, proper shell behavior for script debugging
- **Files Modified**: `src/executor.c` (both execute_external_command functions)

### Maintained Excellence: All Previous Achievements
- **Arithmetic expansion in command substitution**: `$(echo $((2+3)))` works perfectly
- **String inequality operator**: `if [ "$a" != "$b" ]` fully supported
- **For loop variable expansion**: `for item in $list` with IFS field splitting
- **Logical operators in conditionals**: Complex && and || combinations
- **Self-contained command substitution**: Native lusush execution

## Remaining Development Opportunities (6 failing tests)

### High-Impact Fixes Available

#### 1. Test Framework Issues (2 tests)
- **pwd command** and **cd command** tests failing due to quoting in test framework
- **Root Cause**: Complex command string escaping through multiple shell layers
- **Impact**: Test framework limitation, not actual functionality issue
- **Approach**: Test framework refinement or alternative test approach

#### 2. Case Pattern Parsing (1 test)
- **Environment variable processing** failing on `HOME=*` patterns
- **Root Cause**: Parser handling of `=` character in case patterns
- **Error**: "Expected ')' after case pattern"
- **Impact**: Advanced scripting scenario edge case
- **Approach**: Parser enhancement for special characters in patterns

#### 3. Advanced Features (3 tests)
- **Long string processing**: printf format specification handling
- **Multiple command substitutions**: Output formatting refinement
- **Recursive function test**: Complex recursion edge case
- **Impact**: Advanced usage scenarios and edge cases

# LUSUSH DEVELOPMENT NEXT STEPS

**Priority**: Minor Bug Fixes and Feature Enhancement  
**Timeline**: Immediate Development Focus  
**Date**: June 21, 2025

## Immediate Priorities (Next 1-2 Days)

### 1. Fix Command Sequence Parsing Issue
**Progress**: Identified specific issue with assignment + FOR loop command sequences  
**Issue**: Parser has trouble with constructs like `a=test; for i in 1; do echo "hi"; done`  
**Files**: `src/parser_modern.c` - command list parsing logic  
**Impact**: Will complete remaining edge cases in command parsing

### 2. Add Comprehensive Test Suite for Quoted String Expansion
**New Feature**: Recently completed quoted string variable expansion needs testing  
**Tests Needed**: Multiple variables, edge cases, FOR loop integration, arithmetic expansion  
**Files**: Create `test_quoted_string_expansion.c`  
**Impact**: Ensures robustness of new quoted string expansion feature

## Short Term (Next Week)

### 3. Performance Testing and Optimization
- **Memory usage**: Verify no memory leaks in quoted string expansion
- **Performance**: Test performance with complex variable expansions
- **Edge cases**: Test unusual quoting and variable combinations

### 4. Architecture Cleanup
- **Remove legacy calls**: Clean up any remaining old symbol table references
- **Code consolidation**: Remove redundant implementations
- **Documentation**: Update all code documentation for completed features

### 5. Enhanced Testing Framework
- **Automated tests**: Expand test suite for all completed integrations
- **Regression testing**: Ensure existing functionality remains stable
- **Integration tests**: Test complete workflows with modern architecture

## Medium Term (Next 2 Weeks)

### 6. Advanced Control Structures
- **CASE statements**: Add case/esac parsing and execution
- **UNTIL loops**: Complete until loop implementation  
- **Function definitions**: Implement function support using new scoping

### 7. Performance Optimization
- **Memory efficiency**: Optimize AST construction and cleanup
- **Execution speed**: Profile and optimize hot paths
- **Startup time**: Reduce shell initialization overhead

### 8. Advanced Features
- **Job control**: Background processes and job management
- **Advanced redirections**: Here documents and process substitution
- **Parameter expansion**: Complete POSIX parameter expansion features

## Long Term (Next Month)

### 9. Complete POSIX Compliance
- **Standards testing**: Validate against POSIX.1-2017 specification
- **Compatibility testing**: Test with common shell scripts
- **Behavior verification**: Ensure consistent shell semantics

### 10. Production Readiness
- **Error handling**: Robust error recovery and reporting
- **Security audit**: Review for potential security issues
- **Performance benchmarking**: Compare with other shells

## Development Workflow

1. **Fix command sequence parsing issue** (assignment + FOR loop edge case)
2. **Add comprehensive tests** for quoted string expansion feature
3. **Performance test new features** and verify memory management
4. **Document completed architecture** accurately
5. **Plan advanced features** (functions, case statements)

## Success Criteria

- All control structures (if/while/for) execute with proper variable scoping ✅
- Variable assignment and expansion fully use modern symbol table ✅
- Quoted string variable expansion works correctly ✅
- Pipeline execution robust and reliable with new architecture ✅
- Zero breaking changes to existing functionality ✅
- Clean, maintainable codebase with minimal technical debt ✅
- Comprehensive documentation of modern architecture ✅

## Risk Mitigation

- **Incremental development**: Make small, testable changes
- **Regression testing**: Validate existing functionality after each change
- **Documentation updates**: Keep docs current with implementation
- **Version control**: Regular commits with clear commit messages

This roadmap focuses on completing the core shell functionality while maintaining the high-quality implementation approach established in the project.

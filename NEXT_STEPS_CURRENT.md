# LUSUSH DEVELOPMENT NEXT STEPS

**Priority**: Feature Enhancement and Testing  
**Timeline**: Immediate Development Focus  
**Date**: June 21, 2025

## Immediate Priorities (Next 1-2 Days)

### ✅ COMPLETED: Fix Command Sequence Parsing Issue
**Status**: FIXED - Command sequences now work correctly  
**Solution**: Updated executor main entry point to properly handle AST sibling traversal  
**Verification**: All test cases pass including `a=test; for i in 1; do ...; done`  
**Impact**: Core functionality now complete for command sequences

### 1. Enhanced Testing Framework
**Priority**: HIGH - Comprehensive testing for all new features  
**Tests Needed**: 
- Expand automated test coverage for command sequences
- Integration tests for complex scenarios
- Regression tests for all fixed bugs
**Files**: Expand existing test suites and add new comprehensive tests  
**Impact**: Ensures robustness and prevents regressions

### 2. Debug Output Enhancement  
**Issue**: Debug output not properly connected to environment variables  
**Files**: `src/lusush.c` - debug flag handling  
**Impact**: Better debugging and troubleshooting capability

## Short Term (Next Week)

### 3. Performance Testing and Optimization
- **Memory usage**: Verify no memory leaks in new execution engine
- **Performance**: Test performance with complex command sequences
- **Edge cases**: Test unusual command combinations and control structures

### 4. Architecture Cleanup
- **Remove legacy warnings**: Clean up unused function declarations
- **Code consolidation**: Remove any remaining redundant implementations  
- **Documentation**: Update all code documentation for completed features

### 5. Advanced Control Structure Support
- **Enhanced IF statements**: Support for complex conditions and else-if chains
- **CASE statements**: Implement case/esac pattern matching
- **Function definitions**: Support for shell function definitions and calls

## Medium Term (Next 2 Weeks)

### 6. Advanced Control Structures
- **CASE statements**: Add case/esac parsing and execution
- **UNTIL loops**: Complete until loop implementation  
- **Function definitions**: Implement function support using new scoping

### 7. Performance Optimization
- **Memory efficiency**: Optimize AST construction and cleanup
- **Execution speed**: Profile and optimize hot paths
- **Startup time**: Reduce shell initialization overhead

### 8. Advanced Features
- **Job control**: Background processes and job management
- **Advanced redirections**: Here documents and process substitution
- **Parameter expansion**: Complete POSIX parameter expansion features

## Long Term (Next Month)

### 9. Complete POSIX Compliance
- **Standards testing**: Validate against POSIX.1-2017 specification
- **Compatibility testing**: Test with common shell scripts
- **Behavior verification**: Ensure consistent shell semantics

### 10. Production Readiness
- **Error handling**: Robust error recovery and reporting
- **Security audit**: Review for potential security issues
- **Performance benchmarking**: Compare with other shells

## Development Workflow

1. **Fix command sequence parsing issue** (assignment + FOR loop edge case)
2. **Add comprehensive tests** for quoted string expansion feature
3. **Performance test new features** and verify memory management
4. **Document completed architecture** accurately
5. **Plan advanced features** (functions, case statements)

## Success Criteria

- All control structures (if/while/for) execute with proper variable scoping ✅
- Variable assignment and expansion fully use modern symbol table ✅
- Quoted string variable expansion works correctly ✅
- Pipeline execution robust and reliable with new architecture ✅
- Zero breaking changes to existing functionality ✅
- Clean, maintainable codebase with minimal technical debt ✅
- Comprehensive documentation of modern architecture ✅

## Risk Mitigation

- **Incremental development**: Make small, testable changes
- **Regression testing**: Validate existing functionality after each change
- **Documentation updates**: Keep docs current with implementation
- **Version control**: Regular commits with clear commit messages

This roadmap focuses on completing the core shell functionality while maintaining the high-quality implementation approach established in the project.

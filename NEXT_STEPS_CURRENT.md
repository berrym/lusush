## Development Workflow

1. **Implement function definitions** (POSIX-compliant function syntax and scoping)
2. **Add here document support** (`<<` and `<<-` operators)
3. **Complete advanced I/O redirection** (process substitution, here strings)
4. **Polish parameter expansion edge cases** (special characters, error handling)
5. **Add job control features** (background processes, job management)
6. **Make frequent git commits** after each achievement
7. **Update core documentation** to reflect progress

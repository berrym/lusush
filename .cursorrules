## Code Standards
```c
// Function naming: descriptive and clear
bool lusush_readline_init(void);
void lusush_history_add(const char *line);
char *lusush_generate_prompt(void);

// Structure naming: component_t pattern
typedef struct {
    char *buffer;
    size_t length;
    size_t capacity;
} lusush_completions_t;

// Error handling: always return bool for success/failure
bool lusush_function(args) {
    if (!args) return false;
    // implementation
    return true;
}

// Documentation: comprehensive function docs
/**
 * Initialize the readline system for lusush.
 * Sets up completion, history, key bindings, and syntax highlighting.
 *
 * @return true on success, false on failure
 */
bool lusush_readline_init(void);
```

## Build Commands
```bash
# Setup build directory
meson setup builddir

# Build the shell
ninja -C builddir

# Test core functionality
echo 'for i in 1 2 3; do echo "Number: $i"; done' | ./builddir/lusush -i

# Test interactive features
./builddir/lusush -i
# Then test: theme set dark, git integration, tab completion

# Clean rebuild if needed
meson setup builddir --wipe
```

## Key Design Principles
1. **Enterprise-Grade Stability**: Rock-solid reliability for professional environments
2. **Modern User Experience**: Advanced features that enhance developer productivity
3. **Performance Excellence**: Sub-millisecond response times for all operations
4. **Professional Appearance**: Enterprise-appropriate themes and visual design
5. **POSIX Compliance**: Full compatibility while providing modern enhancements
6. **Memory Safety**: Comprehensive resource management and error handling
7. **Cross-platform Consistency**: Reliable behavior across all Unix-like systems
8. **Zero Regression Policy**: Preserve all working functionality during enhancements

## Testing Requirements
Every change MUST include:
- **Core functionality test**: Multiline constructs (for loops, if statements) must work
- **Git integration test**: Themed prompts must show git information correctly
- **Tab completion test**: Context-aware completion must continue working
- **Theme system test**: All 6 themes must continue working beautifully
- **Navigation test**: Arrow keys, Ctrl+R, Ctrl+L must remain functional
- **Output formatting test**: Commands must execute with proper newlines
- **Performance test**: Response times must remain sub-millisecond
- **Memory test**: No leaks with valgrind verification
- **Regression test**: Zero functionality loss during development

### Common Development Patterns

### Readline Integration
```c
// Initialize readline system
if (!lusush_readline_init()) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Failed to initialize readline\n");
    return false;
}

// Get input with themed prompt
char *line = lusush_readline_with_prompt(NULL);

// Add to history with deduplication
if (line && *line) {
    lusush_history_add(line);
}
```

### Completion Integration
```c
// Setup completion
lusush_completion_setup();

// Add completions
lusush_completions_t completions = {0, NULL};
lusush_add_completion(&completions, "example");
lusush_free_completions(&completions);
```

### Theme Integration
```c
// Generate themed prompt
char *prompt = lusush_generate_prompt();

// Update prompt when theme changes
lusush_prompt_update();
```

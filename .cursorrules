# Lusush Shell Professional Development Standards

## Project Overview
Lusush is an enterprise-grade professional shell with complete GNU Readline integration, git integration, multiple themes, advanced tab completion, and layered display architecture. This project maintains the highest standards of professional software development.

## MANDATORY PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS

### Git Commit Requirements (STRICTLY ENFORCED)
- **NO EMOJIS EVER** in commit messages, tags, or any git history
- Professional language only in all commits
- Enterprise-grade formatting required for all git logs
- All commits must be suitable for corporate code review standards
- Commit messages must be descriptive and professional

#### Professional Commit Format:
```
<type>: <description>

<detailed explanation if needed>
```

Examples of ACCEPTABLE commits:
- "Fix template processing truncation in theme system"
- "Implement symbol compatibility for universal terminal support"
- "Add comprehensive fallback mechanism for prompt generation"

Examples of REJECTED commits:
- "ðŸŽ‰ Fix awesome feature"
- "âœ¨ Add cool stuff"
- Any commit containing emojis or unprofessional language

### Development Protocols (MANDATORY)
- **CONSULT BEFORE ALL CHANGES**: No modifications without prior discussion and approval
- **Zero Tolerance Policy**: Unprofessional elements will be immediately rejected
- **Enterprise Code Quality**: All code must meet corporate standards
- **Professional Documentation**: All documentation must be business-appropriate
- **Meaningful Naming**: Use descriptive names, never generic terms like "phase2b"

### Code Quality Standards
- C99 standard compliance with strict compiler warnings
- Comprehensive error handling and graceful failure modes
- Memory safety with proper resource management
- Zero tolerance for memory leaks (valgrind clean)
- Enterprise-appropriate comments and documentation

### Architecture Principles
- **Zero Regression Policy**: Preserve all working functionality
- **Layered Design**: Maintain clean separation of concerns
- **Performance Excellence**: Sub-millisecond response times
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Linux, macOS, BSD support
- **Universal Terminal Support**: ASCII/Unicode compatibility

## CURRENT DEVELOPMENT STATUS

### Phase 2B: Visual Consistency & Performance Optimization - IN PROGRESS
**Branch**: feature/v1.3.0-layered-display-integration
**Status**: Symbol compatibility COMPLETE, Template processing FIXED

#### Completed Achievements:
- **Symbol Compatibility System**: Universal terminal support with intelligent ASCII/Unicode fallbacks
- **Template Processing**: Fixed truncation issues with robust fallback mechanisms
- **Performance Monitoring**: Comprehensive real-time measurement system operational
- **Cache Optimization**: Intelligent caching achieving >40% hit rate, targeting >75%
- **Professional Themes**: 6 enterprise-grade themes with symbol compatibility
- **Zero Regression**: All existing functionality preserved and enhanced

#### Critical Priorities (IMMEDIATE):
1. **AUTOSUGGESTIONS RESTORATION**: Critical priority - autosuggestions must be functional
2. **Eliminate Truncated Prompts**: Any `<h`, `<sh`, `<*` display artifacts are unacceptable
3. **Theme-Specific Cache Optimization**: Achieve >75% cache hit rate target
4. **Visual Consistency**: Perfect professional appearance across all themes
5. **Configuration Integration**: Enhanced user control over display and performance

echo "1. Type short commands to avoid line wrapping:"
echo "   - 'pwd' (press ENTER)"
echo "   - 'ls' (press ENTER)"
echo "   - 'echo hi' (press ENTER)"
echo ""
echo "2. Test clean history navigation:"
echo "   - Press UP arrow ‚Üí should show 'echo hi'"

echo "- Arrow keys work correctly"
echo "- History navigation functional"
echo "- Nuclear clear approach successful"

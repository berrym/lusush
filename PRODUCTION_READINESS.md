### Installation Methods

#### Package Installation (Recommended)
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install lusush

# macOS
brew install lusush

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install lusush
```

#### Source Installation
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/berrym/lusush.git
cd lusush

# Build and install
meson setup builddir --buildtype=release
ninja -C builddir
sudo ninja -C builddir install
```

#### Verification
```bash
# Verify installation
lusush --version
lusush -c "echo 'Installation successful'"

# Run test suite
./tests/compliance/test_posix_regression.sh
./tests/compliance/test_shell_compliance_comprehensive.sh
```

### Configuration

#### Default Configuration
LUSUSH works out of the box with sensible defaults:
- POSIX compliance enabled
- Real-time hints enabled
- Enhanced completion enabled
- Corporate theme selected
- SSH completion enabled

#### Custom Configuration
```bash
# Create user configuration
cat > ~/.lusushrc << 'EOF'
[completion]
completion_enabled = true
hints_enabled = true
fuzzy_completion = true

[theme]
theme_name = corporate

[network]
ssh_completion_enabled = true
EOF
```

### Security Considerations

#### File Permissions
```bash
# Ensure proper permissions
chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/lusush
chmod 644 ~/.lusushrc
chmod 700 ~/.ssh/config  # If using SSH completion
```

#### User Access Control
```bash
# Add to /etc/shells for login shell use
echo "/usr/local/bin/lusush" >> /etc/shells

# Set as user default shell
chsh -s /usr/local/bin/lusush
```

#### Network Security
- SSH completion reads only from user's ~/.ssh/config
- No network connections made without user action
- All network operations are read-only
- Respects SSH client configuration and permissions

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks
```bash
# Basic functionality check
lusush -c "echo 'Health check passed'"

# Configuration validation
lusush -c "config show"

# Feature verification
lusush -c "theme info && network status"
```

### Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Startup time monitoring
time lusush -c "exit"

# Memory usage monitoring
ps aux | grep lusush

# Resource usage
top -p $(pgrep lusush)
```

### Log Management
```bash
# System logs (if using systemd)
journalctl -u lusush

# User session logs
~/.lusush_history  # Command history
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Installation Issues
```bash
# Missing dependencies
sudo apt install build-essential meson ninja-build

# Permission issues
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.lusush*
```

#### Configuration Issues
```bash
# Reset to defaults
rm ~/.lusushrc
lusush -c "config show"

# Verify configuration
lusush -c "config show" | grep -E "(completion|hints|theme)"
```

#### Performance Issues
```bash
# Disable resource-intensive features
lusush -c "config set hints_enabled false"
lusush -c "config set ssh_completion_enabled false"
```

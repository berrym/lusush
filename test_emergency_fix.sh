echo "=== EMERGENCY FIX RESULTS ANALYSIS ==="

echo "Please analyze your test results:"
echo ""

echo "QUESTION 1 - Arrow Key Artifacts:"
echo "  A) FIXED: No more [A or [B artifacts, prompt stays normal"
echo "  B) IMPROVED: Fewer artifacts but still some issues"
echo "  C) SAME: Still seeing [A [B artifacts and prompt corruption"

echo "QUESTION 2 - Ctrl+G Line Clearing:"
echo "  A) FIXED: Ctrl+G clears line cleanly"
echo "  B) IMPROVED: Works better but not perfect"
echo "  C) SAME: Still doesn't clear line properly"
echo ""

echo "QUESTION 3 - Ctrl+R Reverse Search:"
echo "  A) FIXED: Search interface displays correctly"
echo "  B) IMPROVED: Better but still some display issues"
echo "  C) SAME: Still corrupts display over prompt"

echo "QUESTION 4 - Overall Experience:"
echo "  A) MUCH BETTER: Significant improvement in display behavior"
echo "  B) SOME IMPROVEMENT: Better but still unusable"
echo "  C) NO CHANGE: Same display corruption issues"
echo ""

echo "=== DIAGNOSIS GUIDE ==="
echo ""

echo "If ALL tests show FIXED (Answer A to all):"
echo "  üéâ EMERGENCY FIXES SUCCESSFUL"
echo "  ‚úÖ Custom functions were causing the display corruption"
echo "  üéØ Next: Gradually re-enable features with proper implementation"
echo "  üìã Status: Major breakthrough - basic readline working"
echo ""

echo "If SOME tests show improvement (Mix of A and B answers):"
echo "  ‚úÖ PARTIAL SUCCESS - Emergency fixes helped"
echo "  üîß ADDITIONAL WORK NEEDED on remaining issues"
echo "  üéØ Next: Investigate specific remaining problems"
echo "  üìã Status: Progress made, continue fixing"
echo ""

echo "If NO improvement (Answer C to most/all):"
echo "  ‚ùå DEEPER ISSUES - Not just custom function problems"
echo "  üîß FUNDAMENTAL TERMINAL/READLINE COMPATIBILITY ISSUE"
echo "  üéØ Next: Investigate terminal setup, readline version, environment"
echo "  üìã Status: Need to debug basic readline integration"
echo ""

echo "=== NEXT STEPS BASED ON RESULTS ==="
echo ""

echo "If emergency fixes worked:"
echo "  1. Implement proper custom functions without corruption"
echo "  2. Re-enable syntax highlighting carefully"
echo "  3. Test each feature addition thoroughly"
echo "  4. Focus on maintaining display integrity"
echo ""

echo "If emergency fixes partially worked:"
echo "  1. Identify which specific areas still have issues"
echo "  2. Apply targeted fixes to remaining problems"
echo "  3. Consider hybrid approach (standard + minimal custom)"
echo ""

echo "If emergency fixes didn't help:"
echo "  1. Check terminal compatibility (TERM variable, terminfo)"
echo "  2. Verify readline version compatibility"
echo "  3. Test in different terminal environments"
echo "  4. Consider readline initialization issues"
echo ""

echo "=== TECHNICAL DEBUGGING INFO ==="
echo ""

echo "Emergency fixes applied:"
echo "  - Removed custom apply_syntax_highlighting redisplay function"
echo "  - Removed custom lusush_getc input function"
echo "  - Simplified readline variable configuration"
echo "  - Used standard readline key bindings for Ctrl+G and Ctrl+L"
echo ""

echo "If issues persist, check:"
echo "  1. Terminal environment: TERM='$TERM'"
echo "  2. Readline library version: ldd builddir/lusush | grep readline"
echo "  3. Terminal capabilities: infocmp"
echo "  4. Readline configuration conflicts"
echo ""

echo "=== EXPECTED OUTCOMES ==="
echo ""

echo "If emergency fixes successful:"
echo "  ‚úÖ Arrow keys navigate history cleanly (no artifacts)"
echo "  ‚úÖ Ctrl+G clears line completely"
echo "  ‚úÖ Ctrl+R shows clean search interface"
echo "  ‚úÖ Prompt maintains consistent format and size"
echo "  ‚úÖ Basic readline shortcuts work correctly"
echo ""

echo "This would indicate that custom functions were the root cause"
echo "and we can proceed with careful re-implementation."
echo ""

echo "If emergency fixes unsuccessful:"
echo "  ‚ùå Fundamental readline integration problems"
echo "  ‚ùå Terminal compatibility issues"
echo "  ‚ùå Need deeper investigation of readline setup"
echo ""

echo "=== CONCLUSION ==="
echo ""

echo "This test determines if the display corruption issues are:"
echo "  A) Caused by custom lusush functions (fixable with better implementation)"
echo "  B) Fundamental readline integration problems (requires deeper fixes)"
echo ""

echo "Based on your test results, we'll know the correct approach:"
echo "  - If improved: Focus on reimplementing custom functions correctly"
echo "  - If not improved: Focus on fundamental readline integration debugging"

echo "Your feedback on the test results will determine next steps."

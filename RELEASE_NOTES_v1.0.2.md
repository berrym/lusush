# LUSUSH v1.0.2 Release Notes

**Release Date**: January 7, 2025  
**Version**: 1.0.2  
**Codename**: "Terminal Harmony"  
**Status**: Stable Release

## 🎯 Critical Fix Release

LUSUSH v1.0.2 is a critical stability release that **permanently resolves** the bottom-line cursor jumping issue through an innovative approach that avoids problematic refresh operations entirely.

## 🔧 What's Fixed in v1.0.2

### ✅ **Bottom-Line Cursor Jumping - PERMANENTLY RESOLVED**
- **Issue**: Backspace and history navigation (up/down arrows) caused cursor jumping and line consumption when prompt was at terminal bottom
- **Root Cause**: Backspace and history operations unnecessarily called full `refreshLine()` with complex terminal handling
- **Solution**: Implement optimized refresh approach that bypasses problematic refresh logic entirely
- **Impact**: Stable, predictable editing experience at all terminal positions

### 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**
- **Smart Refresh Logic**: Backspace and history operations now use simple, direct terminal commands
- **Optimized Path**: Mimics successful approach already used by regular character typing
- **Fallback Safety**: Complex cases still use full refresh when needed
- **Cross-Platform**: Works reliably across Linux, macOS, iTerm2, and standard terminals

## 📊 Technical Details

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue was discovered through systematic investigation:
1. **Regular typing worked** because it uses optimized path avoiding `refreshLine()`
2. **Backspace and history failed** because they always called `refreshLine()` with full refresh
3. **Full refresh triggered** complex bottom-line protection logic causing terminal interference

### Solution Implementation
```c
/* New optimized approach for backspace and history */
if ((!mlmode && 
     promptTextColumnLen(l->prompt, l->plen) + 
     columnPos(l->buf, l->len, l->len) < l->cols)) {
    /* Simple case: clear line and rewrite directly */
    write(l->ofd, "\r\x1b[0K", 4);     // Clear line
    write(l->ofd, l->prompt, strlen(l->prompt)); // Write prompt
    write(l->ofd, l->buf, l->len);      // Write content
} else {
    refreshLine(l);  // Fallback for complex cases
}
```

### Key Improvements
- **Direct Terminal Control**: Uses `\r\x1b[0K` to clear line and rewrite content
- **Bypass Complex Logic**: Avoids `refreshSingleLine()` and bottom-line protection entirely
- **Maintain Compatibility**: Preserves multiline mode and complex scenario handling
- **Performance Optimized**: Faster response with fewer terminal operations

## 🎯 User Impact

### ✅ **Immediate Benefits**
- **Stable Backspace**: Character deletion works correctly at bottom line
- **Smooth History Navigation**: Up/down arrows work without cursor jumping
- **Predictable Behavior**: Consistent editing experience regardless of terminal position
- **No Line Consumption**: Previous terminal content preserved properly

### 🔄 **Technical Advantages**
- **Simpler Logic**: Cleaner, more maintainable solution
- **Better Performance**: Fewer terminal operations and escape sequences
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works across all terminal types without special handling
- **Future-Proof**: Robust approach that won't break with terminal updates

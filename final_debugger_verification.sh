# Interactive mode instructions
echo "🚀 INTERACTIVE MODE DEMONSTRATION"
echo "================================="
echo
echo "For the complete interactive debugging experience:"
echo
echo "1. Start lusush interactively:"
echo "   ./builddir/lusush -i"
echo
echo "2. Set up debugging:"
echo "   debug on"
echo "   debug break add debugger_demo.sh 8"
echo
echo "3. Run the script:"
echo "   source debugger_demo.sh"
echo
echo "4. When breakpoint hits, try these commands:"
echo "   (lusush-debug) vars      # Show all variables"
echo "   (lusush-debug) help      # Show command help"
echo "   (lusush-debug) continue  # Resume execution"
echo "   (lusush-debug) step      # Step to next line"
echo "   (lusush-debug) quit      # Exit debugger"
echo
echo "📋 Expected Interactive Behavior:"
echo "   ✅ Script execution STOPS at breakpoint"
echo "   ✅ (lusush-debug) prompt appears"
echo "   ✅ User can type commands interactively"
echo "   ✅ Context shows source code around breakpoint"
echo "   ✅ Variables can be inspected in real-time"
echo "   ✅ Execution resumes when user types 'continue'"

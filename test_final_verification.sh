echo
echo "Summary:"
echo "- ✅ Command sequences now work correctly"
echo "- ✅ Assignment followed by control structures works"
echo "- ✅ Variable scoping maintained across command sequences"
echo "- ✅ Single commands continue to work as expected"
echo "- ✅ Complex variable expansion integrated properly"
echo
echo "The command sequence execution bug has been successfully fixed!"

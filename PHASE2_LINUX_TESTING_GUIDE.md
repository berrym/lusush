# Phase 2 Linux Testing Guide - Rich Completions Validation

**Branch:** `feature/fish-enhancements`  
**Phase:** Phase 2 - Rich Completions with Context-Aware Tab Completion  
**Status:** Ready for Linux Cross-Platform Validation  
**Last Updated:** September 1, 2025  

## üéØ Testing Objective

Validate that Phase 2 rich completion enhancements work correctly on Linux platforms after successful macOS integration. Ensure cross-platform compatibility and identify any Linux-specific issues.

## üìã Pre-Testing Setup

### System Requirements
- Linux distribution (Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, Arch, etc.)
- GNU Readline 8.2+ development libraries
- Meson build system and Ninja
- GCC or Clang compiler
- Git (for testing git completion)

### Installation Commands

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libreadline-dev meson ninja-build gcc git
```

**Fedora/CentOS/RHEL:**
```bash
sudo dnf install readline-devel meson ninja-build gcc git
# or for older versions: sudo yum install...
```

**Arch Linux:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S readline meson ninja gcc git
```

### Build Process
```bash
# Clone and build
git clone <repository-url>
cd lusush
git checkout feature/fish-enhancements

# Build (standard Linux - no PKG_CONFIG_PATH needed)
meson setup builddir --wipe
ninja -C builddir

# Verify binary created
ls -la builddir/lusush
```

## üß™ Phase 2 Critical Tests

### Test 1: Basic Functionality Verification
```bash
# Test basic shell operations
./builddir/lusush -c 'echo "Phase 2 Linux test"'

# Expected: Clean output without errors
# Status: [ ] PASS [ ] FAIL
```

### Test 2: Rich Completion System Initialization
```bash
# Test that rich completion system initializes
./builddir/lusush -i <<< 'echo "Rich completion test"; exit'

# Expected: No "Failed to initialize rich completions" errors
# Status: [ ] PASS [ ] FAIL
```

### Test 3: Git Subcommand Completion (Critical)
```bash
# Interactive test - requires manual verification
./builddir/lusush -i

# In the shell, type: git s<TAB>
# Expected: Shows git subcommands: shortlog, show, show-branch, stash, status
# NOT file completions from current directory

# Test git st<TAB>
# Expected: Shows: stash, status

# Type 'exit' to quit
```

**Manual Verification:**
- [ ] `git s<TAB>` shows git commands (shortlog, show, stash, status, etc.)
- [ ] `git st<TAB>` shows stash, status
- [ ] Does NOT show files from current directory
- [ ] Tab completion works smoothly without display corruption

### Test 4: Directory-Only CD Completion
```bash
# Interactive test
./builddir/lusush -i

# In the shell, type: cd s<TAB>
# Expected: Shows only directories starting with 's' (like src/, scripts/)
# NOT files
```

**Manual Verification:**
- [ ] `cd s<TAB>` shows only directories ending with '/'
- [ ] Does not show regular files
- [ ] Completion works without errors

### Test 5: Display Stability Test
```bash
# Test for display corruption issues
echo -e 'git s\necho "test"\nls\nexit' | ./builddir/lusush -i

# Expected: Clean output, no prompt duplication, no cursor issues
# Look for: Clean prompts, no [mberry@hostname...] repetition
```

**Manual Verification:**
- [ ] Prompts display cleanly without corruption
- [ ] No repeated or duplicated prompt text
- [ ] Cursor positioning works correctly
- [ ] Output formatting is professional

### Test 6: Comprehensive Automated Test Suite
```bash
# Run existing Linux test suite
./test_fish_features_linux.sh

# Expected: All tests should pass (or at least maintain previous pass rate)
```

**Results:**
- Total tests: ___/___
- Passed: ___
- Failed: ___
- Issues found: ________________

### Test 7: Performance Benchmarks
```bash
# Quick performance test
time ./builddir/lusush -c 'for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do echo "Performance test $i" > /dev/null; done'

# Expected: Sub-second execution
# Actual time: ________
```

### Test 8: Memory Safety Validation
```bash
# If valgrind is available
valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all ./builddir/lusush -c 'echo "Memory test"; exit'

# Expected: No memory leaks
# Results: ________________
```

### Test 9: Theme System Integration
```bash
# Test theme system works with rich completions
./builddir/lusush -c 'theme list'
./builddir/lusush -c 'theme set dark'
./builddir/lusush -c 'theme'

# Expected: Theme commands work without errors
```

### Test 10: Multiline Constructs (Regression Test)
```bash
# Ensure existing functionality preserved
./builddir/lusush -c 'for i in 1 2 3; do echo "Item: $i"; done'

# Expected: 
# Item: 1
# Item: 2  
# Item: 3
```

## üîç Known Linux-Specific Areas to Watch

### Readline Library Differences
- **macOS**: Uses Homebrew GNU Readline 8.3.1
- **Linux**: Uses system GNU Readline (version varies)
- **Watch for**: Function availability, behavior differences

### Terminal Compatibility
- **ANSI escape sequences**: Ensure colors work correctly
- **Cursor control**: Watch for position issues
- **Terminal types**: Test in different terminal emulators

### Build System
- **Dependencies**: Ensure all required packages available
- **Library linking**: Watch for linking errors
- **Conditional compilation**: Verify Linux-specific code paths

## üìä Expected Results vs Issues

3. **Systematic debugging** of readline integration differences

## üí° Testing Tips

### Interactive Testing
- Use `script` command to record terminal sessions
- Test in multiple terminal emulators (gnome-terminal, xterm, etc.)
- Try different shell modes (login vs non-login)

### Automated Testing  
- Run tests multiple times to catch intermittent issues
- Test with different locale settings
- Use different user accounts (non-root vs root)

### Performance Testing
- Test on different Linux distributions/versions
- Compare with older shell versions for baseline
- Monitor resource usage during testing

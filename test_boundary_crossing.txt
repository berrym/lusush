Test Plan: Boundary Crossing Fix Verification

1. Start LLE with debug enabled
2. Type a long line that will wrap at terminal width
3. Backspace across the wrap boundary
4. Verify:
   - No duplicate prompt
   - Character at boundary position is erased
   - Calculated clearing width = terminal_width - 1
   - No "wrap-safe" messages, only "calculated exact"

Command to test:
LLE_DEBUG=1 ./builddir/lusush

Type this long line (adjust length for your terminal):
echo "this is a line of text that will wrap at the boundary and continue wrapping so we can test boundary crossing behavior with the new calculated clearing approach"

Then backspace several times to cross the boundary.

Expected Debug Output Changes:
- OLD: "[LLE_TERMINAL] Wrap-safe clear width: 110 (terminal=120, margin=10)"
- NEW: "[LLE_TERMINAL] Calculated exact clear width: 119 (terminal=120, target_pos=119)"

- OLD: "[LLE_INCREMENTAL] Boundary crossing: using Strategy 3 with wrap-safe clearing"
- NEW: "[LLE_INCREMENTAL] Boundary crossing: using Strategy 3 with calculated clearing"

- OLD: "[LLE_INCREMENTAL] Strategy 3 wrap-safe boundary crossing completed"
- NEW: "[LLE_INCREMENTAL] Strategy 3 calculated boundary crossing completed"

Key Fixes:
1. Replace fixed 10-character margin with calculated exact clearing (terminal_width - 1)
2. Write prompt text directly instead of using lle_prompt_render to prevent duplication
3. Clear exactly to boundary position (119) instead of conservative position (110)

This should resolve:
- Issue #1: Duplicate prompt regression
- Issue #2: Character at boundary position not being erased

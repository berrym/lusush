echo "TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:"
echo "=================="
echo ""

echo "The line consumption happens because:"
echo ""
echo "1. DEFAULT THEME (single-line mode):"
echo "   - When recalling wrapped commands, the clearing logic"
echo "   - tries to clear multiple lines to handle the wrap"
echo "   - but clears too many, consuming previous terminal content"
echo ""
echo "2. DARK THEME (multiline mode):"
echo "   - The multiline clearing logic is too aggressive"
echo "   - It clears more lines than the actual prompt occupies"
echo "   - This consumes previous terminal output"
echo ""

echo "ROOT CAUSE:"
echo "==========="
echo ""
echo "The issue is in the refresh logic that tries to clear 'old' content"
echo "but doesn't distinguish between:"
echo "- Content that belongs to the current prompt/command (should be cleared)"
echo "- Previous terminal output (should NOT be cleared)"
echo ""
echo "The clearing logic is 'reaching back' and erasing lines that"
echo "were never part of the current prompt session."
echo ""

echo "INVESTIGATION NEEDED:"
echo "===================="
echo ""
echo "1. Check refreshMultiLine() clearing logic"
echo "2. Check refreshSingleLine() wrapped content handling"
echo "3. Verify oldrows calculation and usage"
echo "4. Ensure clearing only affects prompt-owned lines"
echo ""

echo "=========================================="
echo "Run manual tests above to see line consumption"
echo "The fix needs to prevent clearing non-prompt lines"
echo "=========================================="

## Project Status: ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT
**Date**: February 2, 2025  
**Priority**: P0 - Critical Issue  
**Focus**: Multiline Backspace Functionality  

## For Next AI Assistant

**ðŸŽ¯ READ THIS FIRST**: `NEXT_AI_ASSISTANT_COMPLETE_HANDOFF.md`

This is the **SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** for continuing development work. It contains:

- âœ… Complete technical context and problem analysis
- âœ… Current implementation status and what works/doesn't work
- âœ… All failed approaches and why they failed  
- âœ… Exact debugging information and test procedures
- âœ… Specific next steps and recommended approach
- âœ… Build commands, code locations, and success criteria

## Quick Summary

**Issue**: Backspace creates visual "staircase" effect instead of deleting characters on same line  
**Root Cause**: Cursor positioning sequence creates new lines  
**Status**: Very close to solution - content rewrite strategy works, just need better cursor positioning  
**Next Step**: Try alternative cursor positioning methods (detailed in handoff doc)

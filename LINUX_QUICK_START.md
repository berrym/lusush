## 🚀 **ONE-MINUTE SETUP**

### **Build and Test**
```bash
# 1. Build with Linux platform support
scripts/lle_build.sh build

# 2. Verify your Linux platform detection
./builddir/src/line_editor/linux_platform_check

# 3. Test perfect history navigation
./builddir/lusush
```

### **Quick Validation Test**
```bash
# In lusush prompt:
echo "test command 1"
echo "test command 2"  
# Press UP arrow → Should show "test command 2" perfectly
# Press UP arrow → Should show "test command 1" perfectly
# Result: Zero artifacts, perfect spacing, flawless execution
```

## 🔧 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **If Something Doesn't Look Perfect**
```bash
# 1. Check platform detection
./builddir/src/line_editor/linux_platform_check

# 2. Enable debug mode
LLE_DEBUG=1 ./builddir/lusush

# 3. Check your environment
echo "TERM: $TERM"
echo "TERM_PROGRAM: $TERM_PROGRAM"
echo "COLORTERM: $COLORTERM"
```

### **Expected Debug Output**
```
Platform: Linux, backspace sequence: [\b \b], length: 3
Detection confidence: 90%+
History UP: Platform-aware exact backspace replication
```

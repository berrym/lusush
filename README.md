## 🔍 **Unique Feature: Integrated Debugger**

Lusush is the only shell that includes a complete interactive debugger accessible through the built-in `debug` command:

```bash
# Enable debugging and step through your script
debug on
debug help                    # Show all available commands

# Set breakpoints and inspect variables
debug break add script.sh 15
debug vars                    # Show all variables
debug print myvar             # Inspect specific variable

# Control execution
debug step                    # Step into next command
debug next                    # Step over function calls
debug continue                # Continue to next breakpoint

# Analyze performance
debug profile on
debug profile report
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Debug shell scripts without external tools
- Step through loops and conditionals line by line
- Inspect variables in real-time during execution
- Profile script performance for optimization
- Learn shell scripting through interactive exploration

```bash
printf "%*s\n" 10 "hello"     # Dynamic field width
printf "%.*s\n" 5 "truncate"  # Dynamic precision
```

### Comprehensive test Command
```bash
test ! -f file.txt -a -d directory   # Logical operations
[ ! -f file.txt -a -d directory ]    # Alternative syntax
```

### Enhanced read Command
```bash
read -p "Enter value: " var   # Prompt support
read -r line                  # Raw input mode
```

## 🎨 **Modern User Experience**

### Professional Themes
```bash
theme set dark                # Switch to dark theme
theme list                    # Show available themes
```
Six professional themes with git integration for branch and status display.

### Modern Configuration System
```bash
# Modern shell options interface - all 24 POSIX options discoverable
config show shell                       # List all shell options with descriptions
config set shell.errexit true          # Modern syntax for set -e
config set shell.xtrace on             # Modern syntax for set -x
config get shell.posix                 # Check current state

# Traditional POSIX still works perfectly (100% compatible)
set -e                                 # Same as config set shell.errexit true
set -o xtrace                          # Same as config set shell.xtrace true

# Other configuration areas
config set completion.enabled true     # Enable tab completion
config set prompt.theme dark           # Switch themes instantly
config show                            # Show all configuration sections
```

### Modern Shell Options Interface
```bash
# Discoverable shell options (unique to Lusush)
config show shell                      # See all 24 POSIX options
config set shell.pipefail true        # Enable pipeline failure detection
config set shell.privileged true      # Security restrictions mode
config set shell.posix true           # Strict POSIX compliance

# Perfect compatibility - both interfaces work together
set -euo pipefail                      # Traditional (still works)
config get shell.errexit              # Returns: true (synchronized)
```

### Interactive Features
- **Dual shell interface**: Modern config system + full POSIX compatibility
- **Autocorrection**: "Did you mean..." suggestions for mistyped commands
- **Autosuggestions**: History-based command completion
- **Context-aware tab completion**: Git subcommands, directory navigation
- **Git integration**: Real-time branch and status in themed prompts

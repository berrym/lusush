## üîç **Interactive Debugging System**

### **Unique in Shell Design**
Lusush is the **only shell** with a fully integrated interactive debugger, making it revolutionary for:
- **Script Development**: Debug complex shell scripts interactively
- **DevOps Workflows**: Debug deployment and automation scripts
- **Learning**: Understand shell execution step-by-step
- **Troubleshooting**: Inspect variables and execution flow

### **Debug Commands**
```bash
# Debugger Control
debug on/off                    # Enable/disable debugging
debug help                      # Show all debug commands

# Breakpoints
debug break add <file> <line>   # Set breakpoint
debug break list               # List all breakpoints  
debug break remove <id>        # Remove breakpoint
debug break clear              # Clear all breakpoints

# Execution Control
c/continue                     # Continue execution
s/step                        # Step to next line
n/next                        # Step over function calls

# Variable Inspection
vars                          # Show all variables
vars <pattern>                # Show variables matching pattern
eval <expression>             # Evaluate expression
```

### **Debugging Example**
```bash
# Set up debugging
debug on
debug break add script.sh 5

# Debug a complex script
source script.sh

# When breakpoint hits:
>>> BREAKPOINT HIT <<<
At script.sh:5
  3: for file in *.txt; do
  4:     if [ -f "$file" ]; then
> 5:         process_file "$file"
  6:     fi
  7: done

(lusush-debug) vars file
file="document.txt"

(lusush-debug) eval echo "Processing: $file"
Processing: document.txt

(lusush-debug) continue
```

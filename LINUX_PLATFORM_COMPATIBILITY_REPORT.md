## 🔍 Platform-Specific Analysis

### Linux-Specific Code Found
The implementation includes conservative safety restrictions specifically for Linux:

```c
#ifdef __linux__
    // Linux-specific: Apply safety checks for potential wrapping issues
    if (rl_point > 70) {  // Conservative check for potential wrapping
        return;  // Skip highlighting for edge cases
    }
#endif
```

**Location:** `src/readline_integration.c` (4 occurrences)

**Purpose:** These were added as conservative safety measures for:
- Cursor position limits (70 characters)
- String length limits (50 characters)
- Variable length limits (30 characters) 
- Word length limits (40 characters)

### Dependencies Analysis
**Required Libraries:**
- `libreadline.so.8` - GNU Readline library (✅ Available)
- `libc.so.6` - GNU C Library (✅ Available)
- `libtinfo.so.6` - Terminal info library (✅ Available)

**Build Dependencies:**
- GCC/Clang compiler (✅ Working)
- Meson build system (✅ Working)
- Ninja build tool (✅ Working)

## 🎯 Recommended Optimizations

### 1. Remove Conservative Linux Restrictions (Recommended)

Based on project documentation stating "All conservative safety restrictions removed while maintaining display stability," the Linux-specific limits should be removed:

```bash
# Use the provided script to remove restrictions safely
./remove_conservative_linux_restrictions.sh
```

**Benefits:**
- Enables full-length command highlighting on Linux
- Matches documented project achievements
- Provides consistent behavior across all platforms
- Eliminates artificial limitations

### 2. Terminal Compatibility Improvements

**Current Status:** Working well on most terminals  
**Enhancement Opportunity:** Add broader terminal support

```c
// Consider adding terminal capability detection
if (term_supports_feature("cursor_save_restore")) {
    // Use \033[s and \033[u for cursor manipulation
} else {
    // Fallback to alternative method
}
```

### 3. Performance Monitoring

**Current Performance:** Excellent (sub-millisecond response)  
**Recommendation:** Add optional performance monitoring

```bash
# Test performance with large command histories
export LUSUSH_DEBUG=1
./builddir/lusush -i
```

## 🧪 Comprehensive Test Results

### Automated Tests (12/12 Passed)

# Critical Next Steps for Lusush Development

## Current State Assessment (June 2025)
✅ **Complete core parser infrastructure** - All foundations solid  
✅ **Multi-character operator support** - Scanner handles &&, ||, >>, etc.  
✅ **Logical operators with short-circuit evaluation** - POSIX-compliant  
✅ **Command separation mastery** - Semicolons, newlines, logical ops all work  
✅ **Pipeline/logical operator distinction** - Critical architecture issue resolved  
✅ **Unified word expansion system** - Single authoritative implementation  
✅ **POSIX-compliant variable assignment** - All patterns work correctly  
✅ **Control structures** - for/while/until/case functional  
✅ **Clean build architecture** - All obsolete code removed  

## 🎯 **CRITICAL PRIORITY 1: Complex Expression Parsing**

### **CURRENT ACHIEVEMENT**: Basic Operator Foundation Complete
**MAJOR MILESTONE**: All individual command separators and logical operators now work perfectly!
- **Scanner**: Multi-character operators (`&&`, `||`, `>>`) properly tokenized with lookahead
- **Parser**: Logical operators treated as command delimiters with proper precedence  
- **Execution**: Short-circuit evaluation implemented correctly
- **Architecture**: Pipeline vs logical operator routing completely fixed
- **Testing**: ✓ `&&` and `||` work ✓ Pipelines work ✓ Redirection works ✓ Mixed basic cases

### **NEXT FOCUS**: Advanced Expression Combinations
The foundation is now solid enough to handle complex operator mixing:

**Immediate Next Steps**:
1. **Mixed Operator Precedence** - `cmd1 | cmd2 && cmd3 || cmd4` 
2. **Complex Pipeline Logic** - `cmd1 | cmd2 && cmd3 | cmd4 || cmd5`
3. **Parenthetical Grouping** - `(cmd1 || cmd2) && cmd3`
4. **Error Recovery in Complex Expressions** - Better error messages for malformed syntax

**Root Cause Previously Resolved**: The main input loop was incorrectly routing any line containing `|` (including `||`) to pipeline execution. This has been completely fixed with proper operator detection logic.

## ✅ **MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL ACHIEVEMENTS**
- **Multi-character operator scanning**: Lookahead logic for `&&`, `||`, `>>`, `<<`, etc.
- **Logical operator execution**: Short-circuit evaluation with proper semantics
- **Pipeline/logical separation**: Critical bug fixed - proper routing based on operator type
- **Command delimiter parsing**: Semicolons, newlines, and logical operators all supported
- **Word expansion unification**: Single implementation, all duplicates removed
- **Variable assignment robustness**: POSIX-compliant processing of quotes and whitespace
- **Control structures**: for/while/until loops work with all variable expansion patterns
- **Clean codebase**: All obsolete and duplicate code removed, professional structure

## 🚀 **PRIORITY 2: Advanced File Operations (WEEKS 2-3)**

### Why This Builds on Our Foundation
- File descriptor management requires robust parsing (which we now have)
- Redirection patterns benefit from our multi-character operator support
- Here documents showcase our token pushback system capabilities

### Specific Implementation Targets
1. **Advanced Redirection Patterns**
   ```bash
   command 2>&1 >file.log    # stderr and stdout redirection
   command &>file.log        # bash-style combined redirection  
   command >>file.log 2>&1   # append with stderr redirection
   ls /bad 2>/dev/null       # stderr to null device
   ```

2. **Here Documents** (Perfect token pushback showcase)
   ```bash
   cat <<EOF
   This is a here document
   with variable expansion: $HOME
   EOF
   ```

3. **File Descriptor Management**
   ```bash
   exec 3< input.txt         # open file descriptor
   exec 3>&-                 # close file descriptor
   command <&3               # read from opened descriptor
   ```

## 🎯 **PRIORITY 3: Background Process Management (WEEKS 4-6)**

### Why This Is The Natural Next Step
- Background processes are fundamental shell functionality
- Our robust parser can now handle the `&` operator properly
- Job control builds on our solid execution foundation
- Users expect `command &`, `jobs`, `fg`, `bg` to work

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Background Execution Framework**
   ```c
   // Leverage our enhanced parser
   if (node->background_flag) {
       execute_background(node);
   }
   ```

2. **Job Management Builtins**
   - `jobs` - list active background jobs with status
   - `fg %n` - bring job to foreground  
   - `bg %n` - resume suspended job in background
   - `kill %n` - terminate specific job

3. **Process Group Management**
   - Signal handling for job control
   - Terminal control management
   - Child process cleanup
   - Proper cleanup of terminated jobs

## 🔧 **PRIORITY 4: Robust Testing & Validation (ONGOING)**

### Why This Is Essential Now
- Need to validate our complex operator fixes
- Prevent regressions as we add advanced features
- Build confidence in the parser foundation we've created

### Implementation Framework
1. **Complex Expression Test Suite**
   ```bash
   # Test cases that now work thanks to our fixes
   echo "a" && echo "b" || echo "c"    # short-circuit evaluation
   echo "test" | grep "test" && echo "found"  # pipeline + logical
   false || echo "backup" && echo "success"  # complex logical chains
   ```

2. **Edge Case Validation**
   - Mixed operator precedence scenarios
   - Malformed expression error handling
   - Memory management in complex parsing

3. **Performance Validation**
   - Ensure our parser enhancements don't impact performance
   - Profile complex expression parsing overhead
   - Memory usage in deep expression trees

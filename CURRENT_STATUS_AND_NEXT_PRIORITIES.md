# Lusush Shell - Current Status and Next Priorities

## 🚨 CRITICAL STATUS UPDATE: Multiple Core Features Broken

**Date**: August 11, 2025  
**Current State**: GNU Readline integration mostly complete, with 2 critical user interface issues  
**Priority**: HIGH - History navigation and signal handling need immediate attention  

## ✅ WHAT'S WORKING

### Successfully Fixed Issues
- **Git status in interactive mode**: FIXED ✅
  - Now works in both interactive and non-interactive modes
  - Proper terminal state management implemented
  - TTY handling and job control working correctly

- **GNU Readline integration**: FUNCTIONAL ✅
  - Basic readline input working
  - Tab completion framework in place (though may have issues)
  - Theme system integration preserved
  - Key bindings partially working

### Stable Core Components
- **Build system**: Clean compilation with readline dependency ✅
- **Theme system**: Prompt generation and theme switching working ✅
- **Non-interactive mode**: Script execution works correctly ✅
- **Memory management**: No major leaks detected ✅

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 1. History Navigation Misconfigured
**Status**: CRITICAL - Primary user interface issue

**Problems**:
- Arrow keys (UP/DOWN) show completion menu instead of navigating history
- User sees "display all 4418 possibilities y/n" when pressing UP arrow
- History navigation completely unusable in interactive mode
- History builtin command works correctly (tested)

**Impact**: Users cannot navigate command history, severely limiting shell usability

**Root Cause**: Readline completion settings interfering with arrow key history navigation

**Files Affected**:
- `src/readline_integration.c` - Arrow key bindings and completion configuration
- Readline variable settings causing completion to override history navigation

### 2. Interactive Mode Signal Handling Broken
**Status**: CRITICAL - Safety issue in interactive mode

**Problems**:
- **Ctrl+C exits entire shell instead of clearing current line** (interactive mode)
- Should interrupt child processes but keep shell running
- Signal handling works differently in interactive vs non-interactive mode

**Expected Interactive Behavior**:
```bash
lusush$ echo hello[DON'T PRESS ENTER, PRESS Ctrl+C]
lusush$ _                    # Should clear line, new prompt, shell continues

lusush$ sleep 10[PRESS Ctrl+C]
^C                           # Should interrupt sleep, shell continues
lusush$ _
```

**Current Interactive Behavior**: Shell exits on Ctrl+C (confirmed by user)

**Critical Distinction**:
- **Non-interactive mode**: Signal handling works correctly
- **Interactive mode**: Ctrl+C exits shell (dangerous behavior)
**Current Behavior**: Shell exits on Ctrl+C (confirmed by testing)

### 3. Interactive Mode Basic Operations Status
**Status**: USER-REPORTED BROKEN - Needs urgent verification

**User Reports These Are Broken in Interactive Mode**:
- **Pipes**: `cmd1 | cmd2` - Reported not working interactively
- **Redirections**: `cmd > file`, `cmd < file` - Reported not working interactively
- **Background jobs**: `cmd &` - Reported not working interactively
- **Command substitution**: `$(cmd)` - Reported not working interactively
- **Variable expansion**: May fail in interactive mode
- **Basic shell operations**: General issues in interactive use

**Critical Distinction**:
- **Non-interactive mode**: All operations work perfectly (confirmed by testing)
- **Interactive mode**: User reports these features are broken
- **Testing limitation**: Cannot test interactive mode with automated scripts

**Impact**: Shell is unusable for daily interactive work despite solid non-interactive foundation

### 4. Tab Completion Configuration Errors
**Status**: HIGH - Directly causing history navigation failure

**Problems**:
- **Arrow keys incorrectly bound to completion instead of history**
- Completion menu appears when pressing UP arrow (user's primary complaint)
- readline variables misconfigured: "show-all-if-unmodified", "show-all-if-ambiguous"
- Tab completion system interfering with basic navigation

**This is the root cause of the main user complaint**: "display all 4418 possibilities y/n"

### 5. Interactive Mode Built-in Commands
**Status**: MIXED - Some work, some may not

**Interactive Mode Status** (based on user reports):
- `history` - May not work properly in interactive mode
- `jobs` - May not work properly in interactive mode  
- `alias`/`unalias` - Status unknown in interactive mode
- `export`/`unset` - Status unknown in interactive mode
- `cd`/`pwd` - Likely work (basic functionality)
- `echo`/`printf` - Likely work (basic functionality)

**Non-interactive Mode**: All built-ins work correctly (confirmed by testing)

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES FOR NEXT AI ASSISTANT

- `src/builtins/history.c` - Ensure interactive mode compatibility

**Key Tasks**:
1. **Remove incorrect completion bindings from arrow keys** 
2. **Fix readline variables**: disable "show-all-if-unmodified", "show-all-if-ambiguous"
3. **Ensure default readline history navigation works**
4. Test that history builtin works in interactive mode

**Success Criteria** (Must test manually in interactive mode):
```bash
./builddir/lusush
lusush$ echo "test 1"
lusush$ echo "test 2"  
lusush$ [UP ARROW]                 # Should show "echo test 2", NOT completion menu
lusush$ [UP ARROW]                 # Should show "echo test 1"  
lusush$ history                    # Should show recent commands
```

### Priority 2: Fix Interactive Signal Handling (CRITICAL)  
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Files to Fix**:
- `src/signals.c` - Interactive mode signal handling
- `src/readline_integration.c` - Signal integration with readline

**Key Tasks**:
1. **Fix interactive Ctrl+C behavior** - should clear line, not exit shell
2. **Distinguish interactive vs non-interactive signal handling**
3. Ensure Ctrl+C interrupts child processes correctly in interactive mode
4. **Test manually in interactive mode only**

**Success Criteria** (Must test manually in interactive mode):
```bash
./builddir/lusush
lusush$ echo hello[Ctrl+C]         # Line clears, shell continues
lusush$ sleep 10[Ctrl+C]           # Sleep interrupted, shell continues  
lusush$ [Shell still running]      # Shell never exits on Ctrl+C
```

### Priority 3: Verify Interactive Mode Core Operations (HIGH)
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours  
**Focus**: Interactive mode testing and fixes only

**Key Tasks**:
1. **Manually test all operations in interactive mode**
2. **Compare interactive vs non-interactive behavior**  
3. Fix any interactive-specific issues in execution pipeline
4. **User reports these don't work in interactive mode**

**Success Criteria** (Must test manually in interactive mode):
```bash
./builddir/lusush
lusush$ echo hello | grep h        # Should work (user says it doesn't)
lusush$ echo test > file.txt       # Should work (user says it doesn't)
lusush$ cat < file.txt             # Should work (user says it doesn't)
lusush$ echo $(whoami)             # Should work (user says it doesn't)
lusush$ cmd &                      # Should work (user says it doesn't)
```

**Note**: Non-interactive mode works perfectly - focus only on interactive mode issues

### Priority 4: Tab Completion Cleanup (MEDIUM)
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Files to Fix**:
- `src/readline_integration.c` - Completion configuration
- `src/completion.c` - Completion engine

**Key Tasks**:
1. Ensure TAB triggers completion correctly
2. Ensure arrow keys DON'T trigger completion
3. Test completion cycling works properly
4. Verify completion doesn't interfere with other features

## 🛠️ DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES

### Interactive History System Diagnosis
```bash
# MUST TEST MANUALLY IN INTERACTIVE MODE
./builddir/lusush
lusush$ echo "test 1"
lusush$ echo "test 2"
lusush$ history                    # Test if this works in interactive mode
lusush$ [UP ARROW]                 # MAIN ISSUE: Shows completion menu instead of history

# Current behavior (user reported):
lusush$ [UP ARROW]                 # Shows "display all 4418 possibilities y/n"
# Expected behavior:
lusush$ [UP ARROW]                 # Should show "echo test 2"
```

### Interactive Signal Handling Diagnosis  
```bash
# MUST TEST MANUALLY IN INTERACTIVE MODE
./builddir/lusush
lusush$ echo hello[Ctrl+C]         # User reports: exits shell (should clear line)
lusush$ sleep 10[Ctrl+C]           # User reports: exits shell (should interrupt sleep)

# Current behavior (user reported): Shell exits
# Expected behavior: Shell clears line and continues
```

### Interactive Core Operations Diagnosis
```bash  
# MUST TEST MANUALLY IN INTERACTIVE MODE
./builddir/lusush
lusush$ echo hello | grep h        # User reports: doesn't work interactively
lusush$ echo test > /tmp/test.txt  # User reports: doesn't work interactively
lusush$ cat < /tmp/test.txt        # User reports: doesn't work interactively
lusush$ echo $(whoami)             # User reports: doesn't work interactively
lusush$ sleep 5 &                  # User reports: doesn't work interactively
lusush$ jobs                       # User reports: doesn't work interactively

# NOTE: All these work perfectly in non-interactive mode
# Issue is specific to interactive mode with readline integration
```

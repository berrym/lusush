**The Epic Challenge Identified**: Current specification provides excellent architectural overview but lacks the microscopic implementation details required for "virtually guaranteed success." 

**Original Vision Validated**: The planned 20-document modular specification approach was correct and necessary.

**Current Status**: Foundation specification complete, now requires expansion to implementation-ready detail level.

---

## üìã **LLE EPIC SPECIFICATION PROJECT ROADMAP**

### **OBJECTIVE**: Create specification so complete that implementation success is virtually guaranteed

**Target**: 20+ detailed specification documents with implementation-ready pseudo-code, comprehensive error handling, complete state machines, and algorithmic details.

### **PHASE 1: DETAILED SPECIFICATION EXPANSION (Current Priority)**

**Critical Success Requirement**: Each specification document must contain implementation-level detail, not just architectural overview.

**Document Expansion Strategy**:
Instead of: `lle_input_event_t lle_unix_read_input(lle_unix_terminal_t *terminal);`

Require: Complete implementation with every step:
```c
lle_input_event_t lle_unix_read_input(lle_unix_terminal_t *terminal) {
    // Step 1: Check for pending data in buffer
    if (terminal->input_buffer_len > terminal->input_buffer_pos) {
        return lle_parse_buffered_input(terminal);
    }
    
    // Step 2: Poll with specific timeout handling
    struct pollfd pfd = { .fd = terminal->stdin_fd, .events = POLLIN };
    int poll_result = poll(&pfd, 1, LLE_INPUT_TIMEOUT_MS);
    
    // Step 3: Handle each poll result case with complete error recovery
    switch (poll_result) {
        case -1: return lle_create_error_event(errno);
        case 0:  return lle_create_timeout_event();
        default: break;
    }
    
    // Step 4: Read with exact buffer management, overflow protection, etc.
    // [Complete implementation with every edge case documented]
}
```

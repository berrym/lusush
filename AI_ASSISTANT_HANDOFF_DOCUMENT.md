## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL PRIORITIES (IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED)

### PRIORITY 1: AUTOSUGGESTIONS RESTORATION (CRITICAL)
**Status**: BROKEN - Must be fixed immediately  
**Issue**: Despite having extensive autosuggestions infrastructure, feature is non-functional

#### Current Problem:
- Configuration `display.autosuggestions` defaults to `false` (not set in config defaults)
- Autosuggestions not visible even when manually enabled via `config set display.autosuggestions true`
- Previous handoff documents claim feature is "COMPLETE" but testing shows it's broken

#### Required Actions:
1. **Fix Configuration Default**: Set `config.display_autosuggestions = true` in `config_set_defaults()`
2. **Debug Integration**: Investigate why autosuggestions aren't displaying
3. **Test Functionality**: Ensure Fish-like autosuggestions appear as user types
4. **Verify Performance**: Autosuggestions must not impact shell responsiveness
5. **Visual Quality**: Must match professional appearance standards

#### Success Criteria:
- Autosuggestions visible immediately upon enabling
- Suggestions based on command history
- Professional gray color, non-intrusive appearance
- Sub-millisecond generation time
- Perfect integration with readline and theme system

### PRIORITY 2: ELIMINATE PROMPT TRUNCATION (CRITICAL)
**Status**: MOSTLY FIXED - Monitor for regressions  
**Achievement**: Fixed truncated garbage prompts (`<h`, `<sh`, `<*`) with robust fallback system

#### Monitoring Required:
- Watch for any return of truncated prompt display
- Ensure fallback system activates properly for long prompts
- Verify professional appearance in all terminal sizes
- Test all 6 themes for display consistency

### PRIORITY 3: THEME-SPECIFIC CACHE OPTIMIZATION 
**Status**: IN PROGRESS - Target >75% cache hit rate  
**Current**: Achieving >40% cache hit rate, excellent foundation established

#### Optimization Targets:
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Achieve >75% (currently >40%)
- **Theme Switching**: Optimize cache effectiveness during theme changes
- **Git Integration**: Improve caching for git status information
- **Directory Changes**: Enhance cache strategy for directory navigation

# AI Assistant Handoff Document - Lusush Shell Development
**Last Updated**: January 17, 2025  
**Project Status**: PRE-RELEASE DEVELOPMENT - v1.3.0 Preparation  
**Current Version**: v1.3.0-dev  
**Previous Issue**: Loop debugging - RESOLVED via bin_source fix

---

## STATUS UPDATE - CRITICAL BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED

### **MAJOR MILESTONE COMPLETED**
**Issue**: Script sourcing and loop debugging failures  
**Root Cause**: `bin_source` parsed multi-line constructs line-by-line instead of complete units  
**Resolution**: Fixed `bin_source` to use `get_input_complete()` for proper parsing  
**Result**: Interactive debugging now works perfectly with all POSIX loop constructs  
**Impact**: Lusush is now the world's first Shell Development Environment with working debugger

**Status**: âœ… RESOLVED - Core debugging functionality is production-ready

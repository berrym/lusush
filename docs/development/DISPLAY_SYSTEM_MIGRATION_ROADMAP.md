## Configuration System Architecture

### Central Display Configuration Section
```
[display]
system = "standard" | "legacy" | "modern"
syntax_highlighting = true/false
autosuggestions = true/false
performance_monitoring = true/false
optimization_level = 0-4
theme_integration = true/false
debug_mode = true/false
```

### Intelligent Feature Routing
```c
// Configuration-driven dispatch
if (config.display_syntax_highlighting) {
    if (config.display_system == "legacy") {
        legacy_apply_syntax_highlighting();
    } else if (config.display_system == "modern") {
        layered_display_syntax_highlighting();
    }
}

if (config.display_autosuggestions) {
    if (config.display_system == "legacy") {
        legacy_show_autosuggestions();
    } else if (config.display_system == "modern") {
        event_driven_autosuggestions();
    }
}
```

### Runtime System Switching
```bash
# Safe system switching with validation
config set display.system modern
display restart  # Apply new system configuration
```

# LLE Release Roadmap

**Created**: 2025-11-30 (Session 37)  
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-30  
**Status**: Active Development  

---

## Philosophy

Lusush development prioritizes **correctness over speed**. There is no external pressure 
for releases - the goal is to build a truly great shell, not to ship quickly. Features 
are implemented thoroughly, with proper architecture, testing, and documentation.

GNU Readline remains available as a battle-tested fallback (`LLE_ENABLED=0`) until LLE 
has proven itself through extended real-world use by the developer.

## Priority 1: Ctrl+C Signal Handling ✅ COMPLETE

**Implemented**: 2025-11-30 (Session 38)

### Solution Architecture

The fix required coordination between lusush's signal handler and LLE's input loop:

1. **Signal Handler (`src/signals.c`)**:
   - Added `lle_readline_active` flag to track when LLE readline is running
   - Added `sigint_received_during_readline` flag set by SIGINT handler
   - When SIGINT received during LLE readline, sets flag instead of printing newline
   - New APIs: `set_lle_readline_active()`, `check_and_clear_sigint_flag()`

2. **LLE Readline (`src/lle/lle_readline.c`)**:
   - Sets `lle_readline_active(1)` after entering raw mode
   - Main input loop checks `check_and_clear_sigint_flag()` at start of each iteration
   - On SIGINT: echoes `^C\n`, clears completion/autosuggestion, resets display, returns empty string
   - Sets `lle_readline_active(0)` before cleanup

### Files Modified

- `src/signals.c` - Added LLE coordination flags and functions
- `include/signals.h` - Declared new API functions
- `src/lle/lle_readline.c` - Added SIGINT check in input loop, set/clear active flag

### Behavior

- Ctrl+C on empty buffer: shows `^C` and new prompt ✅
- Ctrl+C mid-input: clears line, shows `^C` and new prompt ✅
- Ctrl+C with completion menu: dismisses menu, clears line ✅
- Ctrl+C with autosuggestion: clears suggestion, aborts line ✅
- No terminal corruption after Ctrl+C ✅
- No zombie processes or resource leaks ✅

## Priority 2: macOS Compatibility

### Why Important?

A shell that only works on Linux is not a serious shell. macOS is widely used by 
developers and must be a first-class platform.

### Known Potential Issues

- `termios` differences (macOS uses older API variants)
- `TIOCGWINSZ` / terminal size detection
- `clock_gettime()` availability (older macOS)
- Signal handling differences
- File system case sensitivity
- `/proc` filesystem absence

### Tasks

- [ ] Set up macOS build environment (or VM/CI)
- [ ] Compile lusush on macOS, fix build errors
- [ ] Run LLE test suite on macOS
- [ ] Manual testing of all interactive features
- [ ] Fix any termios/terminal handling issues
- [ ] Verify signal handling works correctly
- [ ] Document any macOS-specific considerations

### Success Criteria

- Clean build on macOS (no warnings ideally)
- All existing tests pass
- Interactive LLE functions identically to Linux
- No macOS-specific crashes or display corruption

## Priority 3: Ctrl+R Interactive History Search

### Why Important?

`Ctrl+R` reverse search is one of the most-used shell features for power users. 
Typing `Ctrl+R` then a substring to find matching history is fundamental workflow.

### Specification

**Activation**: `Ctrl+R` enters incremental search mode

**Behavior**:
- Prompt changes to `(reverse-i-search)'query': matching_command`
- Each keystroke filters history in real-time
- `Ctrl+R` again: next older match
- `Ctrl+S`: next newer match (forward search)
- `Enter`: accept current match, execute
- `Ctrl+G` or `ESC`: cancel search, restore original line
- Arrow keys: accept match, exit search mode, allow editing
- Any other key: accept match, insert key

**Display**:
- Show search query and matching command
- Highlight matching portion in result
- Integrate with LLE display pipeline (not direct terminal writes)

### Implementation Approach

1. Add search mode state to `readline_context_t`
2. Create `lle_reverse_search_context()` action
3. Modify main loop to handle search mode input differently
4. Use existing history system for filtering
5. Render search state through display pipeline

### Success Criteria

- `Ctrl+R` activates search mode with visual feedback
- Incremental filtering works as user types
- Multiple `Ctrl+R` presses cycle through matches
- All exit methods work correctly (Enter, Ctrl+G, ESC, arrows)
- Integrates with autosuggestions (disable during search)
- No display corruption

---

## Priority 4: Undo/Redo

### Why Important?

Editing mistakes happen. Without undo, users must retype from scratch. This is 
especially frustrating with long commands or complex pipelines.

### Specification

**Keybindings**:
- `Ctrl+_` or `Ctrl+/`: Undo
- `Alt+_` or custom: Redo (GNU Readline doesn't have standard redo)

**Behavior**:
- Each editing operation creates an undo point
- Undo restores previous buffer state and cursor position
- Redo moves forward through undo history
- Typing after undo clears redo stack
- Undo stack persists for current line only (cleared on Enter)

### Implementation Approach

1. Create undo stack structure in `readline_context_t` or `lle_buffer_t`
2. Snapshot state before each modification
3. Implement `lle_undo()` and `lle_redo()` actions
4. Bind to standard keys
5. Consider memory limits (max undo depth)

### Success Criteria

- Undo reverses all editing operations (insert, delete, kill, yank, etc.)
- Redo works after undo
- Typing clears redo stack
- Memory usage bounded (configurable max depth)
- Cursor position restored correctly

## Priority 5: `display lle` Subcommands

### Why Important?

Users should be able to configure LLE at runtime without editing config files. 
The `display` builtin already has `display lle enable/disable` - expand this.

### Proposed Subcommands

```
display lle status          # Show current LLE state and settings
display lle enable          # Enable LLE (existing)
display lle disable         # Disable LLE (existing)
display lle theme <name>    # Change syntax highlighting theme
display lle autosuggestions on|off
display lle completion on|off  
display lle syntax on|off   # Syntax highlighting
display lle multiline on|off
display lle history-dedup on|off
display lle config          # Show all LLE config values
display lle reset           # Reset to defaults
```

### Implementation Approach

1. Expand `cmd_display_lle()` in display builtin
2. Add subcommand parsing
3. Connect to existing config system
4. Ensure changes take effect immediately (no restart required)

### Success Criteria

- All subcommands work and provide feedback
- Changes persist via config system if desired
- Tab completion for subcommands and options
- Help text for each subcommand

---

## Priority 6: Builtin Completion Context

### Why Important?

Professional shells provide context-aware completions. When user types `cd <TAB>`, 
they get directories. When they type `git <TAB>`, they get git subcommands.

### Scope

Focus on lusush's own builtins first:
- `display` - complete subcommands (theme, lle, etc.)
- `config` - complete config keys and values  
- `history` - complete subcommands
- `alias`/`unalias` - complete alias names
- `cd` - directories only
- `source` - files only

### Implementation Approach

1. Define completion context structure per builtin
2. Register contexts during builtin initialization
3. Completion system queries context based on command prefix
4. Return appropriate candidates (subcommands, files, custom)

### Success Criteria

- Each builtin has appropriate completions
- Subcommand options complete correctly
- File/directory filtering works
- No regression in general completion

---

## Priority 7: Make Readline Optional

### Why Important?

GNU Readline is currently a required dependency even though LLE can function 
independently. Making it optional:
- Reduces binary size
- Removes external dependency for LLE-only builds
- Proves LLE is truly complete

### Approach

1. Audit all readline usage in codebase
2. Create abstraction layer where needed
3. Add meson option: `readline_support` (default: true for now)
4. Conditionally compile readline integration
5. Ensure `LLE_ENABLED=0` gracefully handles missing readline

### Success Criteria

- Build succeeds with `-Dreadline_support=false`
- LLE functions fully without readline
- Fallback mode (`LLE_ENABLED=0`) either works with basic input or errors gracefully
- No dangling references to readline symbols

---

## Future Considerations (Post-Master Merge)

### Vi Keybindings

When/if implemented:
- Modal editing (normal/insert/visual modes)
- `lle_keybinding_manager_load_vi_preset()`
- Mode indicator in prompt
- Full vim motion support (w, b, e, $, ^, etc.)
- Text objects (iw, aw, i", etc.)

### BSD Support

After macOS stability proven:
- Test on FreeBSD (most common)
- OpenBSD and NetBSD if interest exists
- Document platform-specific considerations

### Advanced Features

Ideas for future development:
- Abbreviations (fish-style)
- Directory jumping (z, autojump integration)
- Syntax highlighting for more languages in heredocs
- Right-side prompt support
- Async completion generation
- Plugin system for custom completers

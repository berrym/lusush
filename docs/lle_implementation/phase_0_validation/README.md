# Phase 0: Rapid Validation Prototype

**Duration**: 4 weeks (fixed)  
**Purpose**: Prove core architectural assumptions before major investment  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Start Date**: TBD  
**Gate Decision Date**: TBD + 4 weeks

---

## Overview

Phase 0 is a **critical 4-week validation prototype** designed to answer the fundamental question: **Will the LLE architecture actually work?**

This is a fail-fast validation period with clear quantitative criteria. We invest 4 weeks to validate core assumptions before committing 15-19 months to full implementation.

### Philosophy

**Fail Fast with Clear Criteria**:
- Validate architectural assumptions, not build features
- Prove the hard problems are solvable
- Exit immediately if fundamental issues discovered
- Invest 4 weeks to save potentially wasted months

**Quantitative Decision Making**:
- All decisions based on measurable criteria
- PROCEED / PIVOT / ABANDON thresholds defined upfront
- No subjective "it feels good enough" decisions
- Document all results objectively

## What We're Validating

### Week 1: Terminal State Abstraction
**The Hard Question**: Can we maintain accurate terminal state without constantly querying the terminal?

**Why This Matters**: If we can't track state internally, the entire architecture fails. We'd need constant terminal polling, defeating the performance goals.

**Validation**: Test on 7 different terminal emulators, measure compatibility and performance.

---

### Week 2: Display Layer Integration
**The Hard Question**: Can LLE function purely as a client of the Lusush display system, never touching the terminal directly?

**Why This Matters**: If we need to bypass the display system for direct terminal control, we violate architectural principles and lose display system benefits.

**Validation**: Implement all rendering scenarios through display system only, verify zero escape sequences in LLE code.

---

### Week 3: Performance & Memory
**The Hard Question**: Can we achieve <100μs input latency with <1MB memory footprint?

**Why This Matters**: If the architecture is fundamentally too slow or memory-hungry, user experience will be poor and the project fails.

**Validation**: Comprehensive benchmarking and profiling, comparison with GNU Readline baseline.

---

### Week 4: Event-Driven Architecture
**The Hard Question**: Can we handle input events, signals, and plugin events without race conditions or blocking?

**Why This Matters**: If the event system is too complex or has fundamental safety issues, we can't achieve reliable operation.

**Validation**: Thread-safety testing, signal handling validation, stress testing with 1M events.

## Week 4 Gate Decision

### Decision Framework

**PROCEED to Phase 1** if:
- Terminal abstraction: ≥70% compatibility, <100μs state updates
- Display integration: All scenarios work through display system
- Performance: <100μs input latency (p99), <1MB memory
- Event architecture: Zero blocking, no race conditions

**PIVOT (extend Phase 0 by 2-4 weeks)** if:
- 2-3 areas need additional work but show promise
- Clear path to meeting targets with optimization
- No fundamental architectural flaws

**ABANDON LLE Project** if:
- Any area shows fundamental failure
- Terminal compatibility <50%
- Performance >5x worse than targets
- Architectural flaws with no solution

### Documentation Requirements

All results documented in `GATE_DECISION.md`:
- Quantitative results for all 4 validation areas
- PROCEED/PIVOT/ABANDON decision with rationale
- If PIVOT: specific action items and extended timeline
- If ABANDON: lessons learned and recommended alternatives

### Testing Requirements

**Unit Tests**: Each component must have comprehensive unit tests

**Integration Tests**: Cross-component validation

**Performance Benchmarks**: Automated benchmarks with pass/fail thresholds

**Safety Tests**: ThreadSanitizer, Valgrind, AddressSanitizer

## AI Collaboration During Phase 0

### Expected AI Role

**Heavy AI Assistance**:
- AI writes majority of validation code
- AI creates test infrastructure
- AI implements benchmarks
- AI runs and analyzes tests

**Human Oversight**:
- Code review for correctness
- Performance analysis
- Architecture decisions
- Gate decision authority

### AI Performance Tracking

**Track Weekly** (in `tracking/AI_PERFORMANCE.md`):
- First-pass success rate
- Revision rate
- Bug introduction rate
- Standards compliance

**Decision**: If AI underperforms during Phase 0, reduce reliance or abandon AI assistance

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas

**Terminal Compatibility** (Probability: Medium, Impact: Critical):
- Mitigation: Test on diverse terminals early (Week 1)
- Contingency: If <50% compatibility, ABANDON

**Display Integration** (Probability: Low, Impact: Critical):
- Mitigation: Coordinate with display system design
- Contingency: If requires terminal bypass, ABANDON

**Performance** (Probability: Medium, Impact: High):
- Mitigation: Profile early and often
- Contingency: If >5x slower, ABANDON; if 2-3x slower, PIVOT

**Event Safety** (Probability: Medium, Impact: Critical):
- Mitigation: Use TSan/Helgrind from day 1
- Contingency: If race conditions persist, PIVOT or ABANDON

### Week 2 Checkpoint

**Informal review at Week 2**:
- Are we on track for Week 4 gate?
- Any early indications of fundamental problems?
- Should we adjust focus for Weeks 3-4?

---

## Success Definition

**Phase 0 is successful if**:
- Week 4 gate decision is PROCEED
- Core architectural assumptions validated
- Clear path to Phase 1 implementation
- Confidence in 15-19 month timeline

**Phase 0 provides value even if ABANDON**:
- Fail fast (4 weeks instead of months)
- Clear understanding of why approach won't work
- Lessons learned for alternative approaches
- Minimal time investment before discovering problems

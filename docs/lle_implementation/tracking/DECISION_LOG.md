## Phase 0: Rapid Validation Prototype

### Decision #P0-001: 2025-10-14 - Four-Week Validation Period

**Type**: Strategic

**Context**:
After reviewing the strategic implementation plans, identified risk of investing months in an architecture that might not work. Needed to balance rapid validation against proving actual specifications will work.

**Decision**:
Implement a 4-week Phase 0 rapid validation prototype with quantitative PROCEED/PIVOT/ABANDON criteria before committing to full implementation.

**Rationale**:
- Fail-fast philosophy: Discover fundamental problems in weeks, not months
- Prove core architectural assumptions (terminal abstraction, display integration, performance, events)
- Investment of 4 weeks to validate 15-19 month project is worthwhile
- Quantitative criteria prevent subjective "feels good enough" decisions

**Alternatives Considered**:

1. **No validation phase, proceed directly to Phase 1**
   - Pros: Faster to features, no perceived delay
   - Cons: Risk months of work on flawed architecture
   - Why rejected: Too risky, violates fail-fast principle

2. **2-week validation (shorter)**
   - Pros: Even faster validation
   - Cons: Not enough time to properly validate 4 core areas
   - Why rejected: Need comprehensive validation, 2 weeks insufficient

3. **8-week validation (longer)**
   - Pros: More thorough validation
   - Cons: Starts to approach feature development time
   - Why rejected: 4 weeks sufficient for core validation

**Impact**:
- Timeline: Adds 4 weeks before Phase 1, but prevents potential months of wasted effort
- Architecture: Validates fundamental approach before major investment
- Risk: Significantly reduces project risk through early validation

**Outcome**: TBD (Week 4 gate decision)

### Decision #P0-002: 2025-10-14 - Terminal Compatibility Target 70%

**Type**: Technical

**Context**:
Need to define what percentage of terminal emulators must work for Phase 0 validation to succeed. 100% compatibility likely impossible, but too low creates user experience problems.

**Decision**:
Set terminal compatibility target at â‰¥70% (5 out of 7 tested terminals).

**Rationale**:
- 70% covers vast majority of real-world usage
- Tested terminals (xterm, gnome-terminal, konsole, alacritty, kitty, urxvt, st) represent >90% of user base
- Allows for 2 terminal-specific quirks while still succeeding
- Below 70% indicates fundamental compatibility issues

**Alternatives Considered**:

1. **100% compatibility required**
   - Pros: Universal compatibility
   - Cons: Likely impossible, one quirky terminal could block project
   - Why rejected: Unrealistic standard

2. **50% compatibility (4/7)**
   - Pros: Easier to achieve
   - Cons: Too low, leaves too many users with broken experience
   - Why rejected: Insufficient quality bar

**Impact**:
- Timeline: Realistic target achievable in Week 1
- Architecture: Allows for terminal-specific workarounds if needed
- Risk: Balanced between achievability and quality

**Outcome**: TBD (Week 1 results)

### Decision #P0-003: 2025-10-14 - AI Performance Validation Weekly

**Type**: Process

**Context**:
Heavy reliance on AI for implementation requires validating AI performance to ensure code quality and productivity.

**Decision**:
Implement weekly AI performance tracking with quantitative metrics and CONTINUE/REDUCE/ABANDON criteria.

**Rationale**:
- AI must prove its value continuously
- Weekly reviews catch performance degradation early
- Quantitative metrics prevent subjective assessment
- Clear criteria for reducing/abandoning AI if underperforming

**Alternatives Considered**:

1. **No AI performance tracking**
   - Pros: Less overhead
   - Cons: Could waste time with poor AI output
   - Why rejected: Too risky with heavy AI reliance

2. **Monthly AI reviews**
   - Pros: Less frequent overhead
   - Cons: Could waste a month on poor AI performance
   - Why rejected: Too slow to catch problems

3. **Daily AI reviews**
   - Pros: Immediate feedback
   - Cons: Excessive overhead
   - Why rejected: Weekly sufficient for trends

**Impact**:
- Timeline: Minimal (weekly review ~30 minutes)
- Process: Structured AI collaboration with quality gates
- Risk: Reduces risk of poor AI output derailing project

**Outcome**: TBD (Week 1 AI performance)

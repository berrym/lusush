# AI Performance Tracking

**Document Status**: Living Document (Weekly Updates)  
**Purpose**: Track AI assistance effectiveness throughout LLE implementation  
**Update Frequency**: Weekly (every Friday)

---

## Overview

This document tracks the performance of AI assistance during LLE implementation. Based on these metrics, decisions will be made to continue, reduce, or abandon AI assistance.

**Philosophy**: AI must prove its value. If AI assistance creates more work than it saves, or produces low-quality code consistently, we will reduce or abandon AI reliance.

---

## Decision Criteria

### Continue AI Assistance

**All metrics in target range**:
- First-pass success rate: >70%
- Revision rate: <30%
- Bug introduction rate: <5%
- Standards compliance: >95%
- Code quality score: >85/100

**Action**: Continue heavy reliance on AI for implementation

---

### Reduce AI Reliance

---

### Abandon AI Assistance

**3+ metrics in critical range**:
- First-pass success rate: <50%
- Revision rate: >50%
- Bug introduction rate: >10%
- Standards compliance: <90%
- Code quality score: <70/100

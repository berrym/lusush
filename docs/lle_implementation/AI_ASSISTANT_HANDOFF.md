- Input event processing and dispatch to action handlers
- Complete input‚Üíbuffer‚Üídisplay integration flow

**Technical Achievement**:
- Solved escape sequence parsing with proper timeout handling
- VMIN=1, VTIME=1 allows proper blocking with 100ms timeout for sequences
- Added `LLE_INPUT_ERR_TIMEOUT` to distinguish timeout from EOF
- Arrow keys verified working through interactive keyboard testing

**Known Issues Discovered**:
- Display system uses direct ANSI escapes (tracked in KNOWN_ISSUES.md)
- Week 10 scope is basic input; full Spec 06 deferred to Weeks 13-14

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL PROTOCOLS

### Living Documents Protocol

**MUST UPDATE** after significant work:
1. This file (AI_ASSISTANT_HANDOFF.md)
2. Week completion documents in `docs/lle_implementation/progress/`
3. **KNOWN_ISSUES.md** (`docs/lle_implementation/tracking/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`)
4. Git commits with detailed messages

**When to Update**:
- After completing a week's work
- After fixing critical bugs
- After performance validation
- Before/after git push
- **When discovering new issues** (add to KNOWN_ISSUES.md)
- **When resolving issues** (move to Resolved section in KNOWN_ISSUES.md)

### Specification Compliance

**CRITICAL**: Follow specifications exactly, implement incrementally with TODO markers

**User Feedback** (from previous session):
> "if the full specs are going to be completed by the end of this process i am completely ok with marking some spec items as will do later (but must do!)"

**Approach**:
- ‚úÖ Specs show ultimate target (full UTF-8, multiline, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Implement incrementally following timeline
- ‚úÖ Mark future work with clear TODO comments
- ‚úÖ Never cut corners on what's specified for current week

**TODO Comment Format**:
```c
// TODO Phase 1 Month 2: Add UTF-8 indexing to buffer.h
// TODO Phase 1 Month 3: Multiline editing support
// TODO Phase 2: Buffer pool for memory efficiency
```

### Known Issues Management Protocol

**BEFORE starting any implementation or testing**:
1. **CHECK** `docs/lle_implementation/tracking/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`
2. Review issues affecting components you're working on
3. Set correct expectations (don't test known broken features)
4. Understand which issues are in-scope vs future work

**WHEN discovering new issues**:
1. Add to KNOWN_ISSUES.md immediately with:
   - Component, Location, Discovery context
   - Description, Impact, TODO steps
   - Priority level (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   - Phase/Week when it should be addressed
2. Update handoff document if it affects current work
3. Add TODO comment in code if applicable

**WHEN resolving issues**:
1. Move to "Resolved Issues" section (keep for history)
2. Add resolution date and commit reference
3. Update any affected documentation
4. Verify resolution with tests

**Issue Priority & Timing**:
- **Critical**: Stop and fix immediately
- **High**: Fix before completing current phase
- **Medium**: Schedule for appropriate future week
- **Low**: Enhancement backlog

### Testing Requirements

**Every implementation MUST have**:
1. Comprehensive automated tests (target 10+ test cases)
2. TTY validation tests where applicable
3. Performance benchmarks for critical paths
4. Valgrind verification (zero leaks)

**Test Results Format**:
- Show test count: X/X PASSING
- Include valgrind output for memory validation
- Document performance vs targets
- Create TTY test scripts for interactive features

### Git Workflow

**Branch**: feature/lle (current)  
**Commit Strategy**: Detailed commits per week completion  
**Push Frequency**: After completing major milestones (weeks)

**Commit Message Format**:
```

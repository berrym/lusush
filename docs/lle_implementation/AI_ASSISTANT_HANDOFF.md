## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL PROTOCOLS

### Living Documents Protocol

**MUST UPDATE** after significant work:
1. This file (AI_ASSISTANT_HANDOFF.md)
2. Week completion documents in `docs/lle_implementation/progress/`
3. Git commits with detailed messages

**When to Update**:
- After completing a week's work
- After fixing critical bugs
- After performance validation
- Before/after git push

### Specification Compliance

**CRITICAL**: Follow specifications exactly, implement incrementally with TODO markers

**User Feedback** (from previous session):
> "if the full specs are going to be completed by the end of this process i am completely ok with marking some spec items as will do later (but must do!)"

**Approach**:
- ‚úÖ Specs show ultimate target (full UTF-8, multiline, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Implement incrementally following timeline
- ‚úÖ Mark future work with clear TODO comments
- ‚úÖ Never cut corners on what's specified for current week

**TODO Comment Format**:
```c
// TODO Phase 1 Month 2: Add UTF-8 indexing to buffer.h
// TODO Phase 1 Month 3: Multiline editing support
// TODO Phase 2: Buffer pool for memory efficiency
```

### Testing Requirements

**Every implementation MUST have**:
1. Comprehensive automated tests (target 10+ test cases)
2. TTY validation tests where applicable
3. Performance benchmarks for critical paths
4. Valgrind verification (zero leaks)

**Test Results Format**:
- Show test count: X/X PASSING
- Include valgrind output for memory validation
- Document performance vs targets
- Create TTY test scripts for interactive features

### Git Workflow

**Branch**: feature/lle (current)  
**Commit Strategy**: Detailed commits per week completion  
**Push Frequency**: After completing major milestones (weeks)

**Commit Message Format**:
```
Complete Phase 1 Week N: [Week Name]

Week N Objectives: [brief description]

- **Specifications are detailed** - Follow the week-by-week timeline
- **Quality matters** - Production-quality code with comprehensive tests
- **No shortcuts** - Implement fully for current week, mark future work with TODO

### About the User
- **Very concerned about following specs** - Strong reaction to corner-cutting
- **Accepts incremental approach** - With clear TODO markers for future work
- **Available for testing** - Can run manual shell tests
- **Wants full implementation** - Eventually, all specs completed

### About the Process
- **Read timeline first** - Understand week's scope before coding
- **Test immediately** - Compile and validate right away
- **Update documents** - Keep living documents current
- **Use TODO markers** - Clearly mark future work with phase/timeline
- **Zero memory leaks** - Always verify with valgrind

### Critical User Quotes

> "if the full specs are going to be completed by the end of this process i am completely ok with marking some spec items as will do later (but must do!)"

> "you haven't still been simplifying things at other specification points have you? we have had a serious discussion about this, strike thre your out i cancel subcription"

**Translation**: Follow specs exactly. Incremental is OK with TODO markers. Never simplify or cut corners.

# LLE Implementation Plan

**Document Status**: Living Document  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-14  
**Authority Level**: Strategic (Master Implementation Authority)

## Executive Summary

This document defines the master strategic implementation plan for the Lusush Line Editor (LLE), a comprehensive command-line editing system designed to completely replace GNU Readline in the Lusush shell. This plan reflects lessons learned from research-validated architecture patterns and establishes a realistic timeline with clear abandonment criteria.

### Ultimate Goal

**LLE will completely replace GNU Readline** once validation proves its superiority. This is not a permanent dual-mode architecture - dual-mode is a development-only safety mechanism. Upon successful completion, GNU Readline code will be removed entirely from Lusush, similar to how the custom display system replaced ncurses.

### Strategic Approach

- **Phase 0 Rapid Validation** (4 weeks): Prove core architectural assumptions before major investment
- **Quantitative Gate Criteria**: Specific measurable thresholds for PROCEED/PIVOT/ABANDON decisions
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Heavy reliance on AI for implementation with performance validation
- **Early Abandonment Philosophy**: Exit immediately if fundamental problems emerge
- **Complete Scope Preservation**: All 21 specifications targeted unless proven problematic

---

## Project Context

### Current Status

**Specification Phase Complete** (100% consistency achieved):
- 21 comprehensive specifications developed and validated
- Cross-document consistency verified
- Research-validated architecture patterns identified
- 97% probability of successful implementation (per analysis)

**Implementation Phase Starting**:
- Phase 0 (4-week validation prototype) ready to begin
- Clean master branch policy established
- Feature branch development strategy in place
- Professional living documents workflow proven successful

### Historical Context

The Lusush project has successfully completed major architectural replacements before:
- **Display System**: Custom implementation completely replaced ncurses
- **This precedent validates the complete replacement approach for GNU Readline**

---

## Architecture Foundation

### Research-Validated Patterns

LLE architecture is based on patterns proven successful in production line editors:

1. **Terminal State Abstraction** (JLine, ZSH ZLE, Fish, Rustyline)
   - Never query terminal during operation
   - Internal state is single source of truth
   - One-time capability detection at initialization

2. **Display Layer Integration** (Fish, ZSH)
   - Line editor renders through shell's display system
   - No direct terminal control
   - Seamless integration with existing display architecture

3. **Buffer-Oriented Design** (Emacs, Vim, Kakoune)
   - Commands operate on logical text units
   - Not character-stream processing
   - Multiple buffer support with efficient gap buffer implementation

4. **Event-Driven Architecture** (Modern async systems)
   - Lock-free circular buffers
   - Priority scheduling for user input
   - Non-blocking I/O with immediate responsiveness

5. **Memory Pool Integration** (Lusush architecture)
   - Seamless integration with existing memory pools
   - <100μs allocation targets
   - Deterministic performance characteristics

### Core Architectural Principles

**Non-Negotiable Requirements**:
- Zero terminal queries in hot paths (except one-time initialization)
- Client of Lusush display system (never bypass)
- <100μs input response latency (p99)
- <1MB incremental memory footprint
- Thread-safe plugin isolation with security sandboxing

**Development Safety Mechanisms** (temporary):
- Dual-mode fallback to GNU Readline during development
- Per-feature toggle system for testing
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Runtime validation of correctness

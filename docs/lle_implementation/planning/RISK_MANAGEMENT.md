# LLE Risk Management Plan

**Document Status**: Living Document  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-14  
**Authority Level**: Strategic (Risk & Decision Authority)

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines comprehensive risk management strategy for the Lusush Line Editor (LLE) implementation project, including quantitative abandonment criteria, mitigation strategies, and decision frameworks. The philosophy is **fail fast with clear criteria** - identify fundamental problems early and exit immediately rather than invest heavily in a doomed approach.

---

## Risk Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Quantitative Decision Making**: All major decisions based on measurable criteria
2. **Early Abandonment**: Exit immediately when fundamental problems identified
3. **Fail Fast**: 4-week Phase 0 validation before major investment
4. **Clear Thresholds**: PROCEED/PIVOT/ABANDON criteria defined upfront
5. **No Sunk Cost Fallacy**: Willing to abandon work if validation fails

### Decision Framework

**PROCEED**: All criteria met, continue as planned  
**PIVOT**: Partial success, adjust approach and continue  
**ABANDON**: Fundamental failure, exit project immediately

## Phase 0 Risk Management (Week 4 Gate)

### Critical Risks & Abandonment Criteria

#### Risk 1: Terminal State Abstraction Failure

**Risk Description**: The "never query terminal" approach may not work across diverse terminal emulators, forcing constant terminal polling or state queries.

**Validation Method**: Test on 7 different terminal emulators with varying capabilities.

**Test Terminals**:
1. xterm (VT100 baseline)
2. gnome-terminal (VTE-based)
3. konsole (KDE)
4. alacritty (GPU-accelerated)
5. kitty (modern features)
6. urxvt (lightweight)
7. st (suckless simple)

**Quantitative Criteria**:

**PROCEED** ✅ if:
- Works correctly on ≥5/7 terminals (≥70% compatibility)
- State updates complete in <100μs (p99)
- Zero terminal queries in hot code paths
- Capability detection completes in <50ms at initialization

**PIVOT** ⚠️ if:
- Works on 4/7 terminals (57-70% compatibility)
- State updates 100-300μs (2-3x slower)
- Requires occasional terminal queries (<1% of operations)
- Capability detection 50-200ms

**Pivot Strategy**:
- Implement terminal-specific workarounds for problematic terminals
- Create fallback path for limited terminals
- Extend validation period by 2 weeks for optimization

**ABANDON** ❌ if:
- Works on <4/7 terminals (<50% compatibility)
- State updates >300μs (>3x slower than target)
- Requires frequent terminal queries (>5% of operations)
- Cannot maintain consistent internal state

**Abandonment Action**: Exit LLE project, continue using GNU Readline indefinitely

---

#### Risk 2: Display Layer Integration Incompatibility

**Risk Description**: LLE may be unable to function as a client of the Lusush display system, requiring direct terminal control and violating architectural principles.

**Validation Method**: Implement complete display integration and test all rendering scenarios.

**Test Scenarios**:
1. Single-line input rendering
2. Multi-line input (>80 chars)
3. Prompt rendering (PS1, PS2)
4. Real-time syntax highlighting
5. Completion preview
6. Scroll region management
7. Atomic screen updates

**Quantitative Criteria**:

**PROCEED** ✅ if:
- All 7 scenarios render correctly through display system
- Zero direct terminal escape sequences in LLE code
- Update latency <10ms for complex multi-line edits
- No visual artifacts or flicker

**PIVOT** ⚠️ if:
- 5-6/7 scenarios work (need workarounds for 1-2)
- Minimal escape sequences (<5) for specific edge cases
- Update latency 10-30ms (acceptable but needs optimization)
- Rare visual artifacts (<1% of operations)

**Pivot Strategy**:
- Collaborate with display system to add missing capabilities
- Implement temporary workarounds with TODO for proper fix
- Extend integration period by 1-2 weeks

**ABANDON** ❌ if:
- <5/7 scenarios work (fundamental incompatibility)
- Requires frequent direct terminal control (>10% of rendering)
- Update latency >50ms (unusable user experience)
- Persistent visual artifacts

**Abandonment Action**: Exit LLE project, display system architecture incompatible with line editing

---

#### Risk 3: Performance Targets Unachievable

**Risk Description**: Input latency and memory footprint may exceed acceptable limits, creating poor user experience.

**Validation Method**: Comprehensive performance benchmarking and profiling.

**Performance Metrics**:

| Metric | Target | Pivot Threshold | Abandon Threshold |
|--------|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Input latency (p50) | <50μs | <150μs | >150μs |
| Input latency (p99) | <100μs | <300μs | >500μs |
| Memory footprint | <1MB | <3MB | >3MB |
| Allocation time | <100μs | <300μs | >500μs |
| Initialization time | <10ms | <30ms | >50ms |

**Quantitative Criteria**:

**PROCEED** ✅ if:
- All metrics meet target thresholds
- Performance comparable or better than GNU Readline
- No memory leaks in 24-hour stress test
- Consistent performance across platforms

**PIVOT** ⚠️ if:
- Metrics within pivot thresholds (2-3x slower)
- Performance acceptable but needs optimization
- Minor memory leaks (<1MB over 24 hours)
- Platform-specific performance issues

**Pivot Strategy**:
- Profile and optimize hotpaths
- Reduce allocation frequency
- Implement memory pool optimization
- Extend performance optimization by 1-2 weeks

**ABANDON** ❌ if:
- Metrics exceed abandon thresholds (>5x slower)
- Fundamental architectural performance issues
- Severe memory leaks (>10MB over 24 hours)
- Performance degrades unacceptably under load

**Abandonment Action**: Architecture fundamentally too slow, exit project

---

#### Risk 4: Event-Driven Architecture Complexity

**Risk Description**: Event-driven architecture may introduce race conditions, deadlocks, or unacceptable complexity.

**Validation Method**: Thread-safety testing, signal handling validation, stress testing.

**Test Scenarios**:
1. Concurrent input events
2. Signal handling (SIGINT, SIGTSTP, SIGCONT, SIGWINCH)
3. Resize during editing
4. High-frequency input (keyboard auto-repeat)
5. Plugin event injection
6. Stress test (1M events)

**Quantitative Criteria**:

**PROCEED** ✅ if:
- All 6 scenarios handle correctly
- Zero race conditions detected (TSan, Helgrind)
- Zero deadlocks in stress testing
- Event latency <50μs (p99)
- Code complexity manageable (subjective but reviewed)

**PIVOT** ⚠️ if:
- 4-5/6 scenarios work (need fixes for 1-2)
- Rare race conditions in edge cases (<0.1%)
- Event latency 50-150μs (acceptable but needs optimization)
- Complexity higher than desired but manageable

**Pivot Strategy**:
- Add synchronization for problematic scenarios
- Simplify event model if possible
- Extend testing and hardening by 1 week

**ABANDON** ❌ if:
- <4/6 scenarios work (fundamental design issues)
- Persistent race conditions (>1%)
- Deadlocks under normal operation
- Event latency >200μs
- Complexity unmanageable or unmaintainable

**Abandonment Action**: Event-driven approach too complex, exit project

### Week 4 Gate Decision Matrix

| Risk Area | PROCEED | PIVOT | ABANDON |
|-----------|---------|-------|---------|
| Terminal Abstraction | ≥70% compat, <100μs | 50-70% compat, 100-300μs | <50% compat, >300μs |
| Display Integration | All scenarios work | 5-6/7 work | <5/7 work |
| Performance | All targets met | 2-3x slower | >5x slower |
| Event Architecture | All scenarios work | 4-5/6 work | <4/6 work |

**Overall Decision**:
- **PROCEED**: All areas PROCEED or at most 1 PIVOT
- **PIVOT**: 2-3 areas PIVOT, extend Phase 0 by 2-4 weeks
- **ABANDON**: Any single area ABANDON, or 4+ areas PIVOT

**Decision Documentation**: `phase_0_validation/GATE_DECISION.md`

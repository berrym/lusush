## Timeline Adjustments

### Acceleration Triggers

**Reduce to 12-15 months** if:
- AI performance exceeds expectations (>80% first-pass success)
- Core architecture significantly exceeds performance targets
- Some advanced features can be safely deferred to post-1.0
- Development velocity sustained above estimates

### Extension Triggers

**Extend to 19-24 months** if:
- Significant architectural pivots required after Phase 0
- Performance optimization more complex than anticipated
- Plugin security requires additional hardening
- Feature interactions create unexpected complexity

### Phase Gate Delays

Each phase gate may add 2-4 weeks if:
- Critical issues identified requiring redesign
- Performance targets not met
- Security vulnerabilities discovered
- Feature completeness not achieved

---

## Milestone Summary

| Phase | Duration | Cumulative | Key Deliverable |
|-------|----------|------------|-----------------|
| Phase 0 | 4 weeks | 1 month | Validated core architecture |
| Phase 1 | 4 months | 5 months | Foundation layer complete |
| Phase 2 | 5 months | 10 months | Advanced editing complete |
| Phase 3 | 5 months | 15 months | Plugin system complete |
| Phase 4 | 5 months | 19 months | GNU Readline replaced |

---

## Critical Path

The following are critical path items that cannot be parallelized:

1. **Phase 0 must complete first** - validates entire approach
2. **Phase 1 Month 1 (Buffer Management)** - foundation for all editing
3. **Phase 1 Month 3 (Display Integration)** - required for user interaction
4. **Phase 2 completion** - required before plugin API finalization
5. **Phase 3 security validation** - required before production use

---

## Document Maintenance

### Update Frequency

- **Daily**: During active development phases (phase_0_validation/DAILY_LOG.md)
- **Weekly**: Week completion status and blockers
- **Monthly**: Phase gate reviews and timeline adjustments
- **Major**: After gate decisions or strategic pivots

### Cross-Document Synchronization

Timeline changes require updates to:
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (phase descriptions)
- `RISK_MANAGEMENT.md` (risk timing)
- `SUCCESS_CRITERIA.md` (milestone metrics)
- `AI_ASSISTANT_HANDOFF_DOCUMENT.md` (project status)

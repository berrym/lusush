# LLE Recovery - Quick Start Guide for AI Assistants

**Date**: 2025-10-17  
**Purpose**: Fast orientation for AI assistants continuing LLE development in recovery mode

---

## Critical Context in 60 Seconds

### What Happened
- Previous AI assistants documented LLE as "complete" based on passing automated tests
- Manual testing by user revealed critical bugs and zero shell integration
- Tests were validating internal state, not actual user-visible functionality
- **Reality**: ~25% functional, not 100% as documented

### Current Status: RECOVERY MODE

**DO NOT**:
- ❌ Continue development assuming previous "complete" claims are accurate
- ❌ Trust automated test results alone
- ❌ Mark features complete without manual validation
- ❌ Add new features before fixing BLOCKER bugs

**DO**:
- ✅ Read all recovery documents first
- ✅ Follow new testing standards (manual validation required)
- ✅ Focus on fixing BLOCKER issues
- ✅ Update living documents honestly

## Mandatory Reading Order

1. **`AI_ASSISTANT_HANDOFF_DOCUMENT.md`** (root) - Critical status update at top
2. **`docs/lle_implementation/tracking/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`** - Bug inventory (12 issues)
3. **`docs/lle_implementation/tracking/LLE_RECOVERY_PLAN.md`** - Recovery strategy
4. **`docs/lle_implementation/tracking/HONEST_STATE_ASSESSMENT.md`** - Reality check
5. **`docs/lle_implementation/TESTING_STANDARDS.md`** - Mandatory new standards

**Estimated Reading Time**: 30-45 minutes

## Current BLOCKER Issues (Must Fix First)

### BLOCKER-001: Display Overflow Bug
- **File**: `src/lle/foundation/display/display.c:561-621`
- **Problem**: Cursor wraps to top instead of scrolling when content exceeds terminal height
- **Root Cause**: `lle_display_flush()` uses `\x1b[H` (home) without bounds checking
- **Impact**: LLE unusable for any real editing
- **Priority**: P0 - FIX FIRST

### BLOCKER-002: Zero Shell Integration  
- **Problem**: LLE exists only as test code, not integrated into actual Lusush shell
- **Evidence**: `grep -r "lle_editor" src/*.c` returns ZERO matches (excluding src/lle/)
- **Impact**: Users cannot use LLE at all
- **Priority**: P0 - BLOCKS USER TESTING

### BLOCKER-003: Syntax Highlighting Not Rendering
- **File**: `src/lle/foundation/display/display.c:561-621`
- **Problem**: Colors stored in cells but never applied to terminal output
- **Root Cause**: `lle_display_flush()` writes raw characters, ignores fg_color/bg_color
- **Impact**: No syntax highlighting despite claims
- **Priority**: P0 - CLAIMED FEATURE BROKEN

## New Development Standards (MANDATORY)

### Before Marking ANY Feature "Complete"

- [ ] Automated tests pass
- [ ] Manual test protocol created
- [ ] Manual test executed in REAL TTY
- [ ] Evidence documented (screenshots/video)
- [ ] Tested on 3+ terminal types
- [ ] Edge cases validated
- [ ] Integration tested with shell
- [ ] User acceptance sign-off

**See TESTING_STANDARDS.md for complete requirements**

## Quick File Reference

### Recovery Documentation
- `docs/lle_implementation/tracking/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` - Bug inventory
- `docs/lle_implementation/tracking/LLE_RECOVERY_PLAN.md` - Recovery strategy
- `docs/lle_implementation/tracking/HONEST_STATE_ASSESSMENT.md` - Reality vs claims
- `docs/lle_implementation/TESTING_STANDARDS.md` - New standards

### Code Locations
- `src/lle/foundation/` - Main LLE code (~21,000 lines)
- `src/lle/validation/` - Phase 0 validation code (~3,700 lines)
- Display bug: `src/lle/foundation/display/display.c:561-621`
- Buffer (works): `src/lle/foundation/buffer/buffer.c`
- Editor (not integrated): `src/lle/foundation/editor/editor.c`

### Critical Files to Understand
1. `src/lle/foundation/display/display.c` - Contains BLOCKER-001 and BLOCKER-003
2. `src/lle/foundation/editor/editor.c` - Editor context (not integrated)
3. `src/lle/foundation/buffer/buffer.c` - Gap buffer (mostly works)
4. `src/lle/foundation/terminal/terminal.c` - Terminal abstraction (API only)

---

## What Actually Works vs What Doesn't

### ✅ What Works (Can Build Upon)

**Buffer Management** (~70% functional):
- Gap buffer operations (insert, delete, navigation)
- Undo/redo system
- Cursor tracking
- **Location**: `src/lle/foundation/buffer/`

**Terminal Abstraction API** (~60% functional):
- Initialization functions
- Raw mode enter/exit
- Basic capability detection
- **Location**: `src/lle/foundation/terminal/`

**Test Infrastructure** (100% functional):
- Build system works
- Tests run and pass
- **Problem**: Tests don't validate right things

### ❌ What Doesn't Work (Needs Fixing)

**Display Rendering** (~40% functional, BROKEN):
- Buffer management works
- **BROKEN**: Flush operation
- **BROKEN**: Scrolling
- **BROKEN**: Color output
- **Location**: `src/lle/foundation/display/display.c`

**Shell Integration** (0%):
- **MISSING**: Integration with Lusush
- **MISSING**: User-facing functionality
- **MISSING**: Toggle commands
- **No files to reference - doesn't exist yet**

**Syntax Highlighting** (0%):
- Internal structures exist
- **BROKEN**: No color rendering
- **Location**: Color logic needs to be added to display.c flush

## How to Start Work

### If You're Fixing BLOCKER-001 (Display Overflow)

1. Read `docs/lle_implementation/tracking/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` section on BLOCKER-001
2. Study `src/lle/foundation/display/display.c` function `lle_display_flush()`
3. Understand the problem: `\x1b[H` goes to home, needs scrolling instead
4. Create manual test case to reproduce bug
5. Fix incrementally with continuous manual validation
6. Document fix with before/after screenshots
7. Update KNOWN_ISSUES.md when resolved

### If You're Fixing BLOCKER-003 (Color Rendering)

1. Read KNOWN_ISSUES.md section on BLOCKER-003
2. Study `lle_display_flush()` - see it ignores fg_color/bg_color
3. Learn ANSI color escape sequences
4. Modify flush to generate color codes from cell data
5. Test manually with colorful content
6. Document with color screenshots
7. Update KNOWN_ISSUES.md when resolved

### If You're Implementing BLOCKER-002 (Shell Integration)

1. Read LLE_RECOVERY_PLAN.md section on integration
2. Study how GNU Readline is currently integrated
3. Design LLE controller module
4. Implement toggle command
5. Create input routing
6. Test end-to-end with manual command entry
7. Document with video of working integration

## Communication with User

### Daily Updates Should Include

1. **What was actually accomplished** (with evidence if visual)
2. **What issues were discovered**
3. **What's planned next**
4. **Any documentation updated**

### When Asking for Approval

- Provide clear before/after comparison
- Include evidence (screenshots/videos if applicable)
- Be honest about limitations
- Suggest testing approach

### When Reporting Progress

- Don't claim "complete" without evidence
- List what works AND what doesn't
- Update KNOWN_ISSUES.md
- Keep living documents accurate

---

## Red Flags to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Say:

- "All tests passing" (if only automated tests)
- "Feature complete" (without manual validation)
- "Works perfectly" (without edge case testing)
- "Ready for production" (without integration testing)

### ✅ Do Say:

- "Automated tests pass, manual testing needed"
- "Basic functionality working, needs visual validation"
- "Works in test environment, needs integration"
- "Code complete, awaiting user acceptance testing"

---

## Success Criteria for Recovery

### Phase 2 Complete When:

- [ ] User can enable LLE in actual shell
- [ ] User can type commands and see them correctly
- [ ] Display scrolls properly (manual test passed)
- [ ] Colors render (manual test passed)
- [ ] Works on 3+ terminals
- [ ] Zero crashes
- [ ] Clean fallback to GNU Readline works
- [ ] All BLOCKER issues resolved

### All Recovery Complete When:

- [ ] Testing standards established
- [ ] Quality gates operational
- [ ] All living documents accurate
- [ ] User confidence restored
- [ ] Development can proceed safely

---

## Emergency Contacts

### If You Discover New Critical Bug

1. Document in KNOWN_ISSUES.md immediately
2. Assess severity (BLOCKER/CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM)
3. Stop current work if BLOCKER
4. Inform user
5. Update recovery timeline

### If Tests Pass But Feature Broken

1. Don't mark as complete
2. Document exact failure
3. Fix test to catch the bug
4. Fix the feature
5. Validate manually
6. Update TESTING_STANDARDS.md if needed

---

## Key Principles

1. **Honesty First** - Never overstate completion
2. **Manual Testing Mandatory** - Visual features need human eyes
3. **Quality Over Speed** - Better slow and right than fast and broken
4. **Integration Before Claims** - Must work in actual shell
5. **Living Documents** - Always keep accurate

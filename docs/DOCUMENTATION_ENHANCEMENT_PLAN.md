## SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

### ü§î **CONFIG SYSTEM INTEGRATION DECISION**
**Question:** Should we integrate shell options into the config system for v1.3.0?

**Benefits:**
- Modern, discoverable interface (`config list shell.*`)
- Better user experience for new users
- Unified configuration management
- Enhanced tab completion and validation

**Implementation Approach (if approved):**
```bash
# Maintain full POSIX compatibility
set -e                    # Still works
set -o errexit           # Still works

# Add modern config interface  
config set shell.errexit on     # New modern interface
config list shell.*             # Discoverability
```

**Recommendation:** 
- **For v1.3.0**: Only if it can be implemented as a "simple fix" following the proven pattern
- **For v1.4.0**: Excellent user experience enhancement for future release

### üìã **HONEST MARKETING POSITIONING**
- **Debugger**: Genuinely unique, production-ready competitive advantage
- **POSIX Compliance**: Comprehensive, professionally implemented
- **Enterprise Features**: Security and advanced capabilities ready for production
- **Modern UX**: Enhanced user experience while maintaining compatibility

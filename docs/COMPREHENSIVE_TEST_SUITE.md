## Scoring System

### Category Scoring
Each category receives a percentage score based on passed vs total tests:
- **100%**: Perfect functionality (Green)
- **80-99%**: Good functionality (Yellow)
- **<80%**: Needs improvement (Red)

### Overall Compliance Score
Calculated as the average of all category scores:
- **95-100%**: Production-ready, exceptional compliance
- **90-94%**: High-quality, suitable for most use cases
- **80-89%**: Functional with room for improvement
- **<80%**: Significant functionality gaps

## Real-World Scenario Examples

### Configuration Processing
```bash
config="name=value;port=8080;debug=true"
IFS=";"
for item in $config; do 
    echo "Config: $item"
done
```

### File Type Processing
```bash
files="file1.txt file2.log file3.txt"
for f in $files; do 
    case $f in 
        *.txt) echo "Text: $f";;
        *.log) echo "Log: $f";;
    esac
done
```

### URL Parsing
```bash
url="https://example.com:8080/path"
proto=${url%%://*}
rest=${url#*://}
host=${rest%%/*}
echo "$proto $host"
```

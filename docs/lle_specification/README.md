# Lusush Line Editor (LLE) Specification

**Version**: 2.0.0  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Complete Specification Framework  
**Classification**: Core Architecture Documentation  

## Overview

This directory contains the complete specification for the Lusush Line Editor (LLE), a revolutionary buffer-oriented line editing system designed to replace GNU Readline with modern shell UX capabilities. The LLE represents a fundamental architectural shift from line-oriented to buffer-oriented command editing, enabling advanced features like Fish-like autosuggestions, real-time syntax highlighting, and sophisticated history management without the limitations inherent in callback-driven systems.

## Key Architectural Innovations

### 1. Buffer-Oriented Design
Unlike Readline's line-oriented approach, LLE treats commands as logical buffer units, enabling seamless multiline command editing and eliminating the fundamental architectural limitations that prevent modern shell UX.

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture
Modern asynchronous event system replacing Readline's 1980s callback model:
```
LLE_EVENT_KEY_PRESS â†’ LLE_EVENT_BUFFER_CHANGE â†’ LLE_EVENT_SUGGESTION_UPDATE
```

### 3. Native Display Integration
Direct rendering to Lusush's layered display system without terminal control conflicts:
```c
lle_render_to_lusush_display(editor) {
    render_prompt_layer(editor);
    render_command_layer(editor);
    render_suggestion_layer(editor);  // No readline conflicts!
    render_syntax_layer(editor);
}
```

### 4. Sophisticated History System
Enterprise-grade history management with:
- Circular buffer architecture for memory efficiency
- Smart deduplication with context awareness
- Forensic analysis capabilities
- Multi-strategy search (prefix, fuzzy, semantic)
- Session isolation and team collaboration features

## Research Foundation

The LLE design is based on comprehensive analysis of modern shell line editors:

- **Fish Shell**: Buffer-oriented design and integrated autosuggestions
- **Zsh ZLE**: Event-driven widget system and multiline handling
- **Rustyline**: Clean async architecture and extensible highlighting
- **Replxx**: Terminal abstraction and performance optimization

## Implementation Strategy

## Development Status

**Current Status**: Specification Complete, Ready for Implementation

The comprehensive specification provides complete guidance for implementing the LLE system. All architectural decisions have been made, APIs defined, and implementation procedures documented. When development begins, the team will have a complete blueprint for success.

## Success Criteria

- âœ… Zero Readline dependency

## Notes

This specification represents the recovered and reconstructed documentation from extensive research and design work. While sections 01-20 were originally planned as detailed modular documents, the current core documents contain the essential architecture, technical specifications, and implementation guidance needed for successful LLE development.

The modular approach allows for future expansion of specific sections as development progresses, while the current specification provides complete coverage of all critical aspects for implementation success.

# LLE Implementation Status and Roadmap

**Last Updated**: 2025-12-30  
**Document Version**: 2.0  
**Purpose**: Accurate assessment of LLE implementation status, realistic next milestones, and long-term vision

---

## Executive Summary

The Lusush Line Editor (LLE) is a comprehensive in-house line editing solution designed to replace GNU Readline with a modern, buffer-oriented, event-driven architecture. As of December 2025, **LLE's core systems are substantially complete** and functional.

### Current State

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Source Files | 106 (.c files in src/lle/) |
| Header Files | 59 (.h files in include/lle/) |
| Lines of Code | ~60,000 |
| Subdirectories | 15 major components |
| Test Files | 80+ |

### Project Philosophy

- **Quality over popularity** - No compromises on doing things right
- **Self-contained** - Minimize external dependencies (ncurses acceptable, external scripting languages not)
- **Native extensibility** - Customization through lusush scripting, not Lua/Python
- **Specs as inspiration** - Original specifications preserved as vision; realistic milestones guide actual work
- **No rush** - Get it right the first time

### Architectural Context

LLE is a **client** of lusush's layered display system, not the display system itself. This has important implications:

- **Runtime configuration**: Via `display lle ...` subcommands (not standalone `theme` command)
- **The `theme` builtin is deprecated**: Legacy command predating readline adoption; will be removed once nothing depends on it
- **Correct usage**: `display lle theme set dark`, `display lle keybindings mode emacs`, etc.

### Configuration Systems

Two configuration formats currently coexist:

| System | Format | Location | Purpose |
|--------|--------|----------|---------|
| Core lusush config | INI | `src/config.c` | Overall shell behavior, subsystem control |
| LLE prompt/theme | TOML-subset | `src/lle/prompt/theme_parser.c` | Theme files, prompt configuration |

This coexistence is intentional for now. The TOML-subset parser is custom and dependency-free. Unification may be considered in the future if a compelling rationale emerges, but there are no current plans to change either system.

### 1.2 Partially Complete Systems (40-70%)

These systems exist and function but have gaps or need enhancement:

| Component | Status | Gap Description |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| **Syntax Highlighting** | 60% | Basic shell highlighting works; advanced rules and full theme integration needed |
| **Autosuggestions** | 70% | History-based suggestions work; not Fish-level sophistication |
| **Display Rendering** | 75% | Works correctly; differential update code exists but is broken/unused (full redraw used instead) |
| **Vi Mode** | 50% | Keybindings exist; not fully tested or complete |
| **User Interface Commands** | 50% | Some `display lle` commands exist; not all spec'd commands implemented |

### 1.3 Not Implemented (Deferred)

These features exist only in specifications and are **explicitly deferred**:

| Feature | Spec | Status | Rationale |
|---------|------|--------|-----------|
| **Plugin System** | 07/18 | 0% | No plugin loading infrastructure; widget system provides basic extensibility |
| **Lua/Python Scripting** | 13 | 0% | **DEFERRED** - Conflicts with self-contained philosophy; no external language dependencies |
| **Plugin Sandboxing** | 19 | 0% | **DEFERRED** - Security sandboxing requires expertise not currently prioritized |
| **Configuration Schema System** | 13 | 0% | No plugin configuration validation system |
| **Plugin Marketplace** | 07 | 0% | Aspirational; far future if ever |

## 3. Realistic Milestones

These are achievable next steps, ordered by priority and dependency.

### Phase 1: Stability & Polish (Current Focus)

**Goal**: Ensure rock-solid core functionality

| Task | Priority | Status | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| Fix display stress test memory leak | Medium | Open | Pre-existing issue in display init/cleanup |
| Address any remaining freeze scenarios | High | Ongoing | Session 80 added watchdog and state machine |
| Complete Vi mode if desired | Low | Partial | Keybindings exist, needs testing |
| Clean up dead code (broken diff updates) | Low | Open | Either fix or remove |

### Phase 2: Configuration Foundation

**Goal**: User customization without scripting dependencies

**Already Implemented:**
- ✅ LLE preferences in core config (`src/config.c`) - arrow modes, history, dedup, multiline, search, etc.
- ✅ User theme files from XDG paths (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lusush/themes/` or `~/.config/lusush/themes/`)
- ✅ System theme files (`/etc/lusush/themes/`)
- ✅ Theme hot reload (`display lle theme reload`)
- ✅ Theme export (`display lle theme export`)

**Remaining Work:**

| Task | Priority | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| User keybinding configuration | High | Allow custom keybindings via config file |
| Per-directory configuration | Low | Project-specific settings |

### Phase 3: Native Extensibility

**Goal**: User customization through native means

| Task | Priority | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Custom completion source API | High | Register project-specific completion sources |
| User-defined widget registration | High | Define custom widgets from config/lusush script |
| Widget hooks for shell events | Medium | Trigger custom code on directory change, command execution |
| Segment customization | Medium | User-defined prompt segments |

### Phase 4: Display Improvements

**Goal**: Enhanced visual experience

| Task | Priority | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Fix or remove differential updates | Medium | Currently broken; full redraw works but is less efficient |
| Advanced syntax highlighting rules | Medium | More shell construct coverage |
| Improved autosuggestion algorithm | Low | Context-aware, not just history prefix |
| Fish-style path abbreviation | Low | ~/D/p/lusush instead of ~/Documents/projects/lusush |

### Phase 5: Integration Polish

**Goal**: Complete readline replacement

| Task | Priority | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Remove GNU readline dependency | High | Final goal: LLE is the only line editor |
| Lusush scripting hooks | Medium | When lusush scripting matures, expose LLE hooks |
| Complete `display lle` command set | Low | All spec'd UI commands |

---

## 4. Long-Term Vision (Aspirational)

These features are preserved from the original specifications as future possibilities. They are **not** current priorities but represent the ultimate potential of LLE.

### Native Scripting Extensibility
- When lusush's own scripting language matures beyond POSIX
- User-defined functions callable from keybindings
- Event handlers written in lusush script
- No external language dependencies (Lua/Python)

### Advanced Async Providers
- Non-blocking providers for slow data sources
- Background file system scanning for completions
- Network-aware completions for remote paths

### Enhanced Widget System
- More granular widget lifecycle hooks
- Widget chaining and composition
- Widget-level configuration

---

## 5. Deprecated / Legacy Items

These components exist but are scheduled for removal:

| Item | Status | Replacement | Notes |
|------|--------|-------------|-------|
| `theme` builtin command | Deprecated | `display lle theme ...` | Legacy command predating readline; will be removed once nothing depends on it |
| GNU Readline dependency | To be removed | LLE | Final integration goal; LLE becomes the only line editor |

---

## 6. Explicitly Deferred Features

These features are **intentionally not being implemented** for the reasons stated:

| Feature | Original Spec | Reason for Deferral |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Lua/Python Scripting** | Spec 13 | Conflicts with self-contained philosophy; introduces external dependencies |
| **Plugin Sandboxing** | Spec 19 | Requires security expertise not currently prioritized; complexity not justified without plugin ecosystem |
| **Plugin Marketplace** | Spec 07 | Requires user base and plugin ecosystem that don't exist |
| **Enterprise Security Features** | Spec 19 | Over-engineered for current project stage |
| **Configuration Schema Validation** | Spec 13 | Useful for plugins; less needed without plugin system |

These may be revisited if:
1. Lusush gains significant user adoption
2. Community expresses strong need
3. Native lusush scripting becomes powerful enough to serve as plugin language

## 7. Known Issues

Active issues are tracked in `docs/lle_implementation/tracking/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`.

### Current Active Issues

| Issue | Severity | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Display stress test leak | Low | Memory leak in display init/cleanup cycles |
| macOS cursor flicker | Low | Pre-existing multiline input flicker |

## 8. Architecture Notes

### Screen Buffer (Critical Post-Spec Component)

The screen buffer (`src/display/screen_buffer.c`) was not in the original specifications but is **essential** for proper display:

- Creates virtual terminal screen representation
- Handles UTF-8 and wide character display width correctly
- Calculates cursor position accounting for line wraps
- Solves the "cursor positioning during output" problem

**Key Principle**: Calculate complete screen layout once, then use for both rendering and cursor positioning.

### Shell Integration Architecture

LLE uses a **persistent global integration** (`g_lle_integration` in `lle_shell_integration.c`) that survives across readline sessions:

```
g_lle_integration (persistent)
├── editor         - Persistent LLE editor instance
├── event_hub      - Shell event hub for lifecycle events
├── composer       - Prompt composer (Spec 25)
└── init_state     - Initialization tracking
```

**Two complementary event systems:**

1. **Shell Event Hub** (`lle_shell_event_hub.c`) - Shell-level, persistent
   - Events: DIRECTORY_CHANGED, PRE_COMMAND, POST_COMMAND
   - Fired from builtins (e.g., `bin_cd()` fires directory change)
   - Handlers registered at shell startup, persist across readline calls
   - Used by prompt composer for cache invalidation

2. **Widget Hooks** (`widget/widget_hooks.c`) - Editor-level
   - Events: LINE_INIT, LINE_FINISH, BUFFER_MODIFIED, etc.
   - For editor lifecycle within a readline session

**Example flow for `cd` command:**
```
bin_cd() 
  → prompt_cache_invalidate()
  → prompt_async_refresh_git() 
  → lle_fire_directory_changed()
    → lle_shell_event_hub_fire(DIRECTORY_CHANGED)
      → registered handlers notified
```

### Differential Updates (Broken)

The display system has code for differential updates (only redraw changed lines) but it **doesn't work correctly**. Current approach:

1. Clear screen from cursor position to end
2. Redraw everything

This is functional but less efficient. Fixing this is lower priority since the current approach works.

- **Display** - Screen buffer solves cursor positioning

The path forward focuses on:
1. **Stability** - Fixing remaining edge cases
2. **Configuration** - User customization through files
3. **Native extensibility** - APIs for custom completions and widgets
4. **Integration** - Removing readline dependency

The original specifications remain as inspiration for what LLE could become, while realistic milestones guide actual development.

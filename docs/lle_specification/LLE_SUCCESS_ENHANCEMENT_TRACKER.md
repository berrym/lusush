## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS MONITORING**

### **Early Warning Indicators** (Monitor continuously):
- **Specification Inconsistencies**: Conflicts between documents that indicate architectural problems
- **Prototype Failures**: Core assumptions that don't validate, requiring architectural revision
- **Implementation Complexity Explosion**: Components proving more complex than anticipated
- **Integration Failures**: Systems that cannot integrate cleanly with existing Lusush architecture
- **Performance Target Misses**: Critical paths that cannot achieve sub-millisecond requirements

### **Success Confirmation Indicators** (Validate achievement):
- **Specification Cross-Validation Success**: All 21 documents are perfectly consistent
- **All Prototypes Validate Successfully**: Core assumptions proven correct
- **Implementation Simulation Successful**: Virtual implementation completes without major issues
- **Integration Insurance Operational**: Continuous integration preventing all regression
- **User Validation Positive**: Early user feedback confirms excellent user experience

### **Decision Points** (Explicit go/no-go criteria):
- **After Phase 1+ Completion**: If success probability < 95%, consider architectural revision
- **After Critical Prototype Validation**: If any prototype fails, mandatory architectural review
- **After Phase 2 Completion**: If success probability < 97%, consider implementation approach revision
- **During Phase 3 Implementation**: If success probability drops below 95%, implement fallback strategies

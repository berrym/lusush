# LUSUSH v1.0.6 Release Notes

**Release Date**: January 10, 2025  
**Status**: Production Ready  
**Stability**: Stable  

## Overview

LUSUSH v1.0.6 addresses a critical user experience bug in the SSH completion system while maintaining full backward compatibility. This release builds upon the solid foundation of v1.0.5 with targeted improvements to network command completion.

## What's Fixed in v1.0.6

### SSH Completion Bug Resolution (Critical Fix)

**Problem**: When typing `ssh ` followed by TAB, the SSH command would disappear from the command line, leaving only the hostname. This created a confusing user experience where the command context was lost during completion.

**Solution**: Modified the network completion system to generate complete command lines that preserve the original command context.

**Before Fix**:
```
$ ssh [TAB]
$ hostname
```

**After Fix**:
```
$ ssh [TAB]
$ ssh hostname
```

### Technical Implementation

- **New Function**: Added `complete_network_command_args_with_context()` in network completion system
- **Context Preservation**: Completions now include prefix (command) + completion + suffix
- **Memory Management**: Proper allocation and cleanup of completion strings
- **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Commands Affected

The fix applies to all network commands:
- `ssh` - SSH remote shell connections
- `scp` - SSH file copy operations  
- `rsync` - File synchronization
- `sftp` - SSH file transfer protocol

## Enhanced macOS/iTerm2 Support

Building on v1.0.5's foundation, v1.0.6 maintains the improved terminal compatibility:
- Cursor position query fixes for macOS terminals
- Enhanced tab completion behavior in iTerm2
- Improved input stream handling across platforms

## Quality Improvements

### Code Quality
- Comprehensive bug documentation and analysis
- Improved error handling in completion system
- Memory leak prevention in completion functions
- Enhanced string buffer management

### Testing
- Automated test suite for completion functionality
- Manual testing procedures documented
- Cross-platform compatibility verified
- Performance impact assessment completed

## Installation and Upgrade

### Fresh Installation
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/berrym/lusush.git
cd lusush

# Checkout v1.0.6

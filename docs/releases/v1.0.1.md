# LUSUSH v1.0.1 Release Notes

**Release Date**: January 7, 2025  
**Version**: 1.0.1  
**Codename**: "Stable Foundation"  
**Status**: Stable Release

## 🎯 Critical Fix Release

LUSUSH v1.0.1 is a critical stability release that addresses a significant bottom-line cursor jumping issue while maintaining 100% POSIX compliance and all core functionality.

## 🔧 What's Fixed in v1.0.1

### ✅ **Bottom-Line Cursor Jumping Resolution**
- **Issue**: Cursor would jump up and consume previous lines when typing at the bottom of the terminal
- **Root Cause**: Hints system was adding extra text output during line refresh, causing unwanted terminal scrolling
- **Solution**: Disabled hints by default (`hints_enabled = false`) for stable terminal behavior
- **Impact**: All users now experience stable, predictable terminal behavior at all cursor positions

### 🛠️ **Configuration Changes**
- **Hints System**: Now disabled by default for stability
- **User Control**: Advanced users can enable hints via `config set hints_enabled true`
- **Backwards Compatibility**: All existing configurations remain valid
- **Optional Feature**: Hints become an opt-in enhancement rather than default behavior

## 📊 Technical Details

### Root Cause Analysis
The hints system in `refreshShowHints()` function was adding text to the terminal output buffer during every line refresh. When the prompt was positioned at the bottom line of the terminal, this additional hints text caused:
- Terminal scrolling to accommodate extra output
- Cursor position displacement
- Line consumption and overwriting behavior
- Unstable editing experience

### Solution Implementation
```c
// Default configuration change
hints_enabled = false    // Previously: true

// Conditional initialization preserved
if (config.hints_enabled) {
    linenoiseSetHintsCallback(lusush_hints_callback);
    linenoiseSetFreeHintsCallback(lusush_free_hints_callback);
}
```

### Verification Results
- **Manual Testing**: ✅ Bottom-line cursor jumping eliminated
- **POSIX Compliance**: ✅ 49/49 regression tests passing
- **Comprehensive Suite**: ✅ 136/136 compliance tests passing
- **Cross-Platform**: ✅ Verified on Linux, macOS, iTerm2, standard terminals

## 🎯 User Impact

### ✅ **Immediate Benefits**
- **Stable Terminal Behavior**: No cursor jumping at any terminal position
- **Predictable Scrolling**: Terminal scrolls up one line properly when at bottom
- **Reliable Editing**: Consistent experience regardless of cursor location
- **Preserved Functionality**: All POSIX features and advanced capabilities intact

### 🔄 **Configuration Options**
```bash
# Check current hints status (should be false)
config get hints_enabled

# Enable hints for enhanced UX (optional, may cause bottom-line issues)
config set hints_enabled true

# Disable hints for maximum stability (recommended default)
config set hints_enabled false
```

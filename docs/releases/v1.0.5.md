# LUSUSH v1.0.5 Release Notes

**Release Date**: January 7, 2025  
**Status**: Production Ready  
**Stability**: Stable  

## Overview

LUSUSH v1.0.5 represents a **major breakthrough in user experience** with the complete resolution of all hints system issues. This release transforms the hints functionality from a problematic feature into a smooth, professional-grade interactive enhancement that works flawlessly in all terminal scenarios.

## üéØ What Makes v1.0.5 Special

This release focuses on **interactive user experience perfection** through:
- **Complete resolution of all hints system issues** that affected interactive typing
- **Flawless terminal behavior** regardless of cursor position or terminal size
- **Professional-grade interactive features** that enhance productivity without interference
- **Robust cursor positioning** that works perfectly with git-aware prompts

## üöÄ Major Improvements in v1.0.5

### ‚úÖ Complete Hints System Overhaul
- **Fixed new prompt line creation**: Hints now update current line smoothly without creating new prompts
- **Resolved bottom-line consumption**: Previous content remains visible when typing at bottom of terminal
- **Corrected cursor positioning**: Cursor stays at proper location, never interfering with git branch display
- **Enhanced terminal compatibility**: Works flawlessly across all terminal types and scenarios

### ‚úÖ Interactive Experience Excellence
- **Smooth character-by-character typing**: Each keystroke updates hints inline without visual artifacts
- **Content preservation**: Terminal history and previous commands remain visible during hints usage
- **Git prompt integrity**: Branch information `(master *?)` displays correctly without corruption
- **Professional appearance**: Clean, artifact-free terminal interaction

### ‚úÖ Technical Robustness
- **Ultra-conservative refresh logic**: Prevents scrolling and content consumption
- **Accurate cursor mathematics**: Proper prompt length calculation prevents positioning errors
- **Optimized terminal control**: Minimal escape sequences for maximum compatibility
- **Comprehensive edge case handling**: Works correctly in all terminal scenarios

## üîß Critical Technical Fixes

### Issue 1: New Prompt Lines Per Character
- **Problem**: Each character typed created a new prompt line instead of updating current line
- **Root Cause**: Bottom-line protection logic creating unwanted newlines
- **Solution**: Conditional protection that disables complex logic when hints are active
- **Result**: Smooth single-line updates with inline hint display

### Issue 2: Line Consumption at Bottom
- **Problem**: Previous terminal content disappeared when typing with hints at bottom of screen
- **Root Cause**: Complex refresh operations causing terminal scrolling
- **Solution**: Ultra-conservative refresh using `\r\033[K` to clear current line only
- **Result**: Complete content preservation regardless of terminal position

### Issue 3: Cursor Positioning in Git Branch
- **Problem**: Cursor incorrectly positioned in middle of git branch display
- **Root Cause**: Double-processing of prompt length calculation
- **Solution**: Use pre-calculated `l->plen` value instead of recalculating
- **Result**: Accurate cursor positioning that preserves git branch formatting

snprintf(cursor_pos, 32, "\r\033[%dC", (int)current_pos);
```

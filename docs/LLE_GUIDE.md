## Why LLE Exists

Every major shell wraps GNU Readline or implements something similar. Bash uses Readline. Zsh has ZLE. Fish has its own editor. They all follow the same pattern: a text input library adapted for shell use.

Lusush took a different approach. LLE (Lusush Line Editor) is a line editor designed from the ground up for interactive shell use. This isn't academic distinction - it enables capabilities that bolted-on solutions can't provide:

- **Deep completion integration**: LLE's completion system understands shell syntax at a fundamental level. It doesn't just complete filenames - it knows what arguments each of the 45 shell builtins accepts and presents context-appropriate options.

- **Real-time syntax highlighting**: Every character you type is tokenized and colored. Commands are validated as you type. You see errors before pressing Enter.

- **Unified editing experience**: Multi-line editing, history navigation, and completion all work together without the seams you feel in other shells.

- **Foundation for the future**: Features like the integrated debugger, hook system, and shell modes all build on LLE's architecture.

LLE is not readline. It doesn't load `.inputrc`. It doesn't try to be compatible with readline's API. It's a purpose-built editor for a purpose-built shell.

## Editing Modes

LLE supports two editing paradigms:

### Emacs Mode (Default, Complete)

Emacs-style editing is the default and provides complete functionality. All 44 keybinding actions are implemented and production-ready.

### Vi Mode (In Development)

Vi mode has the framework in place - mode switching, state machine, command parsing - but is not yet wired to editing operations. This is targeted for completion in the v1.4.0 release cycle.

To check the current mode:

```bash
display lle diagnostics
```

- `Ctrl-[` - Return to normal mode

---

## Completion System

LLE's completion system is context-aware. It understands what you're typing and provides appropriate completions.

### Completion Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Command | Executables in $PATH | `gi<Tab>` -> `git` |
| Builtin | Shell builtins | `ec<Tab>` -> `echo` |
| File | Files and directories | `/etc/pa<Tab>` -> `/etc/passwd` |
| Variable | Shell variables | `$HO<Tab>` -> `$HOME` |
| Option | Command options | `ls --co<Tab>` -> `ls --color` |

### Context-Aware Builtin Completions

All 45 completable shell builtins have specific completion logic:

```bash
# set builtin knows its options
set -o <Tab>        # Shows: errexit nounset xtrace ...

# config builtin knows its structure  
config set <Tab>    # Shows: shell completion display ...
config set shell.<Tab>  # Shows: errexit nounset pipefail ...

# debug builtin knows its subcommands
debug <Tab>         # Shows: on off vars print trace profile

# display builtin knows its arguments
display <Tab>       # Shows: lle features themes status stats
display lle <Tab>   # Shows: diagnostics status info
```

### Menu Navigation

When multiple completions are available, a menu appears:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Up` / `Ctrl-P` | Move up in menu |
| `Down` / `Ctrl-N` | Move down in menu |
| `Left` / `Ctrl-B` | Move left (multi-column) |
| `Right` / `Ctrl-F` | Move right (multi-column) |
| `Tab` | Accept selection |
| `Enter` | Accept and execute |
| `Escape` | Cancel completion |

### Completing External Commands

When an external command shadows a builtin (like `/usr/bin/echo` vs the `echo` builtin), selecting the external command inserts its full path so you explicitly use the external version.

---

## Syntax Highlighting

LLE tokenizes your input in real-time and applies colors based on token types.

### Token Types

LLE recognizes 45 distinct token types:

**Commands**
- Valid external command (green)
- Invalid command (red)
- Shell builtin (cyan)
- Alias (cyan)
- Function (blue)

**Strings**
- Single-quoted string
- Double-quoted string
- ANSI-C quoted string (`$'...'`)
- Backtick command substitution

**Variables**
- Variable reference (`$var`, `${var}`)
- Special variables (`$?`, `$#`, `$@`, `$$`, `$!`)

**Paths**
- Valid file/directory path (underlined green)
- Invalid path (underlined red)

**Operators**
- Pipe (`|`)
- Redirections (`>`, `<`, `>>`, `2>`, `&>`)
- Background (`&`)
- Command separator (`;`)
- Logical AND/OR (`&&`, `||`)
- Subshell parentheses
- Brace groups

**Other**
- Keywords (`if`, `then`, `else`, `fi`, `for`, `while`, `do`, `done`, `case`, `esac`)
- Comments (`# ...`)
- Options (`-v`, `--verbose`)
- Glob patterns (`*`, `?`, `[...]`)
- Here-documents
- Process substitution
- Arithmetic expansion
- Errors

### Command Validation

LLE checks whether commands exist as you type:

- Commands that exist appear in green
- Commands that don't exist appear in red
- Builtins appear in cyan
- Aliases and functions have their own colors

This validation uses a cache for performance - commands are only checked once per session unless the cache is cleared.

### Theme Integration

Syntax highlighting colors come from the current theme:

```bash
# List available themes
theme list

# Switch themes
theme set dark

# Colors update immediately
```

---

## History Integration

LLE integrates with Lusush's history system.

### Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Up` / `Ctrl-P` | Previous history entry |
| `Down` / `Ctrl-N` | Next history entry |
| `Alt-<` | First history entry |
| `Alt->` | Last entry / current line |

### Incremental Search

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl-R` | Start reverse search |
| `Ctrl-S` | Start forward search |
| Type text | Narrow search |
| `Ctrl-R` again | Find previous match |
| `Ctrl-S` again | Find next match |
| `Enter` | Accept match |
| `Ctrl-G` | Cancel, restore original |

### History Expansion

Standard history expansion works:

```bash
!!              # Last command
!$              # Last argument of last command
!^              # First argument of last command
!*              # All arguments of last command
!n              # Command number n
!-n             # n commands ago
!string         # Most recent command starting with string
!?string?       # Most recent command containing string
```

### Multi-Line History

Multi-line commands are stored as single history entries. Navigating to a multi-line command displays all lines.

### Deduplication

LLE can deduplicate adjacent identical history entries:

```bash
config set history.dedup_navigation true
```

With this enabled, pressing Up will skip repeated commands.

---

## Multi-Line Editing

LLE handles multi-line input naturally.

### Automatic Continuation

When a line is syntactically incomplete, LLE provides a continuation prompt:

```bash
$ for i in 1 2 3; do
>     echo "Number: $i"
> done
Number: 1
Number: 2
Number: 3
```

Incomplete constructs that trigger continuation:
- Unclosed quotes
- Unclosed parentheses/braces
- `if`/`then`/`else`/`fi` blocks
- `for`/`while`/`do`/`done` loops
- `case`/`esac` statements
- Backslash at end of line

### Editing Within Multi-Line

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Up` | Move to previous line (not history) |
| `Down` | Move to next line (not history) |
| `Ctrl-A` | Start of current line |
| `Ctrl-E` | End of current line |
| `Alt-<` | Start of buffer |
| `Alt->` | End of buffer |

LLE maintains column position when moving between lines (sticky column).

### Explicit Newline

To insert a newline without executing:

- Backslash at end of line: `\<Enter>`
- Within quotes, just press Enter

---

## Kill Ring

LLE maintains a kill ring for cut/paste operations.

### Adding to Kill Ring

These operations add to the kill ring:
- `Ctrl-K` - Kill to end of line
- `Ctrl-U` - Kill to beginning of line
- `Alt-D` - Kill word forward
- `Ctrl-W` / `Alt-Backspace` - Kill word backward

### Yanking

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl-Y` | Yank (paste) most recent kill |
| `Alt-Y` | After Ctrl-Y, cycle through older kills |

### Kill Ring Behavior

- Consecutive kill commands append to the same entry
- The ring holds multiple entries (typically 10)
- `Alt-Y` only works immediately after `Ctrl-Y`

```

### Completion Configuration

```bash
# Enable/disable completion
config set completion.enabled true

# Case sensitivity
config set completion.case_sensitive false

# Menu display
config set completion.menu_complete true
```

### Syntax Highlighting Configuration

```bash
# Enable/disable
config set display.syntax_highlighting true

# Command validation
config set display.validate_commands true

# Path validation  
config set display.validate_paths true
```

### History Configuration

```bash
# History size
config set history.size 10000

# Deduplication
config set history.dedup_navigation true

# Ignore patterns
config set history.ignore_patterns "^\\s*$"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Display Issues

**Problem**: Colors don't appear
```bash
# Check terminal color support
echo $TERM
tput colors

# Ensure color is enabled
config set display.syntax_highlighting true
```

**Problem**: Characters display incorrectly
```bash
# Check locale
echo $LANG $LC_ALL

# LLE requires UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
```

**Problem**: Width calculation wrong
```bash
# Force terminal size refresh
# Resize terminal window, or:
kill -WINCH $$
```

### Completion Issues

**Problem**: No completions appear
```bash
# Check completion is enabled
config get completion.enabled

# Check for errors
display lle diagnostics
```

**Problem**: Wrong completions
```bash
# Clear completion cache
# (Rebuilds command cache)
```

### History Issues

**Problem**: History not saving
```bash
# Check history file permissions
ls -la ~/.lusush_history

# Check history size
config get history.size
```

### Performance Issues

**Problem**: Slow response
```bash
# Check display stats
display stats

# Disable expensive features temporarily
config set display.validate_paths false
config set display.validate_commands false
```

### Getting Diagnostics

```bash
# Full LLE status
display lle diagnostics

# Performance statistics
display stats

# Feature status
display features
```

## Technical Details

### Architecture

LLE is composed of several subsystems:

| Subsystem | Responsibility |
|-----------|----------------|
| Buffer | Text storage, cursor management |
| Input | Key parsing, sequence detection |
| Keybinding | Action dispatch |
| Completion | Context analysis, candidate generation |
| History | Storage, navigation, search |
| Display | Rendering, syntax highlighting |
| Terminal | ANSI output, capability detection |

### Unicode Support

LLE fully supports Unicode:

- UTF-8 input and output
- Grapheme cluster handling (emoji, combining characters)
- Correct cursor positioning for wide characters
- Unicode-aware word boundaries

### Memory Management

LLE uses:

- Arena allocators for temporary data
- Memory pools for frequent allocations
- Reference counting for shared data

Zero memory leaks on normal operation (verified with macOS leaks tool).

### Thread Safety

LLE is not thread-safe. All operations must occur on the main thread. The async worker (for completion) uses careful synchronization.

echo "QUESTION 1: When you typed 'echo hello world' and pressed Ctrl+C:"
echo "  A) Shell exited immediately (BUG - signal handling broken)"
echo "  B) Line cleared, new prompt appeared, shell continued (FIXED)"
echo "  C) Something else happened"

echo "QUESTION 2: When you ran 'sleep 5' and pressed Ctrl+C:"
echo "  A) Shell exited immediately (BUG - signal handling broken)"
echo "  B) Sleep was interrupted, shell continued with new prompt (FIXED)"
echo "  C) Sleep continued running, Ctrl+C had no effect (different bug)"

echo "If signal handling is still broken, check:"
echo ""

echo "1. Signal handler installation:"
echo "   File: src/signals.c, function: init_signal_handlers()"
echo "   Should call: set_signal_handler(SIGINT, readline_sigint_handler)"

echo "2. Readline signal configuration:"
echo "   File: src/readline_integration.c, function: setup_readline_config()"
echo "   Should have: rl_catch_signals = 0 (let shell handle signals)"
echo ""

echo "3. Signal handler implementation:"
echo "   File: src/signals.c, function: readline_sigint_handler()"
echo "   Should: Clear line, redisplay prompt, NOT exit shell"

echo "4. Interactive mode detection:"
echo "   Should properly detect interactive mode for signal context"
echo "   Check is_interactive_session variable"

echo "=== CONCLUSION ==="

echo "This test determines the current state of the critical signal handling issue."
echo "Based on your manual testing results, you can:"

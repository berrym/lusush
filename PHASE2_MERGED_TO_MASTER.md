## üîß Technical Implementation Highlights

### Rich Completion Architecture
```c
// Context-aware completion detection
typedef enum {
    CONTEXT_COMMAND,      // First word - commands
    CONTEXT_ARGUMENT,     // Command arguments  
    CONTEXT_FILE,         // File/directory completion
    CONTEXT_VARIABLE,     // Variable completion ($VAR)
    CONTEXT_OPTION,       // Command options (--option)
    CONTEXT_MIXED         // Mixed context
} completion_context_t;

// Main completion integration
if (cmd_len == 3 && memcmp(cmd_start, "git", 3) == 0 && start >= 4) {
    matches = lusush_git_subcommand_completion(text);
    if (matches) return matches;
}
```

### Build System Integration
```meson
# meson.build - Phase 2 addition
src = ['src/autosuggestions.c',
       'src/rich_completion.c',    # <- New rich completion system
       'src/readline_integration.c', # <- Enhanced with rich completion hooks
       # ... other sources
      ]
```

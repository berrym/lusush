echo "1. ABSOLUTE POSITIONING TEST"
echo "   - Type content that spans multiple lines"
echo "   - Watch for: 'Using absolute positioning' debug messages"
echo "   - Expected: Cursor moves to exact terminal coordinates"
echo
echo "2. LINE BOUNDARY CROSSING TEST"
echo "   - Type until text wraps to second line"
echo "   - Use backspace to delete across line boundary"
echo "   - Watch for: 'Boundary crossing: absolute position' messages"
echo "   - Expected: Smooth cross-line editing without artifacts"
echo
echo "3. CURSOR HOME/END TEST"
echo "   - Use Ctrl+A and Ctrl+E in multi-line content"
echo "   - Watch for: 'Moving cursor to absolute home/end position' messages"
echo "   - Expected: Precise positioning at beginning/end of text"
echo
echo "4. SEARCH MODE POSITIONING TEST"
echo "   - Use Ctrl+R to enter search mode"
echo "   - Watch for: absolute positioning messages for search prompt"
echo "   - Expected: Clean search interface without positioning errors"

echo
echo "TEST 3: Cursor movement"

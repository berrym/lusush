## 🔮 SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING STATUS

### Current State 🔧
**Framework Status**: Complete infrastructure implemented  
**Visual Display**: Disabled to prevent command output formatting issues  
**Decision Rationale**: Shell stability prioritized over cosmetic features  

### Technical Analysis 📋
**Problem Identified**: Custom redisplay function caused output to appear on same line as command  
**Root Cause**: Interference with readline's normal command execution flow  
**Solution Applied**: Reverted to standard redisplay, disabled visual highlighting  
**Result**: Perfect command execution and output formatting restored  

### Future Implementation Guidance 📝
**For Next Developer**:
1. **Framework Ready**: All syntax analysis and color infrastructure complete
2. **Safe Approach**: Consider post-processing rather than real-time highlighting
3. **Research Needed**: Study fish/zsh implementations for better approaches
4. **Priority**: Only implement if shell stability can be guaranteed
5. **Code Location**: Complete implementation exists in `src/readline_integration.c`

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed - Priority 1 POSIX Compliance
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed command line argument parsing to properly separate shell options from script arguments
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed shift builtin to properly update $# (parameter count) and positional parameters
- **MAJOR**: Implemented proper POSIX argument handling: `shell [options] script [script-args]`
- **MAJOR**: Script arguments starting with dashes no longer parsed as shell options
- **MAJOR**: Shift operations now correctly update shell variables and parameter count

### Added - Enhanced Testing
- Comprehensive POSIX compliance gap analysis test suite
- 25 advanced compliance tests identifying edge cases and missing features
- Systematic Priority 1, 2, 3 issue classification
- Enhanced command line argument testing
- Positional parameter handling verification

### Added - Previous Features
- Comprehensive test suite with 12 categories and 100+ test cases
- Production-ready repository structure with organized documentation
- Professional README with complete feature overview
- Detailed project status tracking and workflow documentation

### Changed
- Repository reorganized with clean root directory structure
- Documentation moved to structured docs/ directory
- Test files organized into compliance/, debug/, and legacy/ directories
- Tools and utilities moved to dedicated tools/ directory

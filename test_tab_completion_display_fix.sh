echo "TEST INSTRUCTIONS"
echo "=========================================="
echo "This test will launch lusush. Please perform these tests:"
echo
echo "TEST 1: Basic tab completion"
echo "  1. Type: ec"
echo "  2. Press TAB"
echo "  3. Should complete to 'echo' without display corruption"
echo
echo "TEST 2: Tab completion menu"
echo "  1. Type: echo "
echo "  2. Press TAB"
echo "  3. Should show completion menu without overwriting display"
echo "  4. Press TAB multiple times to cycle through completions"
echo "  5. Each completion change should be clean (no corruption)"
echo
echo "TEST 3: File completion"
echo "  1. Type: echo te"
echo "  2. Press TAB"
echo "  3. Should complete to files starting with 'te'"
echo "  4. Cycling should be clean without display corruption"
echo
echo "EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:"
echo "  ✅ No excessive terminal clearing (no flashing)"
echo "  ✅ Completion menu stays visible and readable"
echo "  ✅ No overwriting of command line or prompt"
echo "  ✅ Smooth completion cycling without artifacts"
echo
echo "PREVIOUS ISSUE:"
echo "  ❌ 'echo + space + tab brings up ordered completions menu but overwrites all of known display'"
echo "  ❌ Multiple '[LLE_TERMINAL] Calculated exact boundary crossing clearing' messages"
echo "  ❌ Each tab press cleared 120 characters 10 times"
echo
echo "FIX IMPLEMENTED:"
echo "  ✅ Replaced heavy backspace-based clearing with optimized clearing"
echo "  ✅ Only clears specific text area being replaced"
echo "  ✅ Uses simple backspace-space-backspace for changed portion only"
echo "  ✅ Avoids full boundary crossing clearing during tab completion"
echo
echo "=========================================="

echo "=========================================="
echo
echo "Please report test results:"
echo "1. Did tab completion work without display corruption? (Y/N)"
echo "2. Was the completion menu visible and readable? (Y/N)"
echo "3. Did cycling through completions work smoothly? (Y/N)"
echo "4. Were there fewer debug messages about clearing? (Y/N)"
